      I ~~ OUR CASUALTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is not in the whole British Isles a more efficient military body
      than the Ballyhaine Veterans' Corps. The men look like soldiers when they
      have their grey uniforms on and their brassards on their sleeves. They
      talk like soldiers. They have the true military spirit. There is not a man
      in the company under fifty years of age, but if the Germans attempt a
      landing on the Ballyhaine beach, by submarine or otherwise, they will be
      sorry for themselves afterwards&mdash;those of them who remain alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ballyhaine is a residential suburb, entirely built over with villas of the
      better kind. Each villa has its garden. In times of peace we discuss sweet
      peas or winter spinach or chrysanthemums on our way into town in the
      morning, travelling, as most of us do, by the 9.45 train, with season
      tickets, first class.
    </p>
    <p>
      When our boys went off from us, as they all did early in the war, we felt
      that it was time for us to do something too. There was not the least
      difficulty about enrolling the men. We all joined the corps, even poor old
      Cotter, who must be close on seventy, and who retired from business three
      years ago. He used to bore us all by talking about his rheumatism, but
      when the Volunteer Corps was formed he dropped all that, and went about
      saying that he had never suffered from pain or ache in his life, and could
      do twenty miles a day without feeling it We made Cotter a corporal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Commanding Officer is Haines, who plays the best hand at bridge of any
      man in the club. He held a commission in a line regiment before he went on
      the Stock Exchange. That was thirty-five years ago, and it is not to be
      supposed that his knowledge of soldiering is up-to-date, but he is the
      only one of us who has any knowledge of soldiering at all, so we chose
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women were a difficulty at first. They insisted on regarding us as a
      joke, and used to repeat the absurd witticism of the street boys. I heard
      Janet say "Methusaleers" one day. She denied it, but I am perfectly
      certain she did not say "Fusiliers," My wife fussed about dry socks and
      wanted me to take my umbrella on a route march one wet Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every other member of the corps had similar experiences. It was Tompkins
      who hit on a way of dealing satisfactorily with the women. Tompkins is our
      local doctor. He stays in Ballyhaine all day long when the rest of us go
      up to town, so he naturally knows a good deal about women. He enrolled
      them in a volunteer ambulance brigade, and after that they were just as
      keen as any of us. We did the thing handsomely for them. We bought six
      stretchers, a small motor ambulance waggon, and some miles of bandages.
      Janet and Cotter's youngest girl carried one of the stretchers. I should
      not like to say that my wife actually hoped I should be wounded, but I
      think she would have liked the chance of bandaging any other man in the
      corps. The rest of the women felt as she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawback to Ballyhaine as a centre of military activity is the
      difficulty of finding a place for practising field manoeuvres. There is
      the golf links, of course, but we got tired of marching round and round
      the golf links, and we did not want to dig trenches there. Haines, who
      does not play golf, drew up a plan of trench digging which would have
      ruined the golf links for years. But we would not have that. Nor could we
      dig in each other's gardens, or practise advancing over open country in
      skirmishing order when there was no open country. The whole district is a
      network of high walls with broken glass on top of them, a form of defence
      rendered necessary by the attacks of small boys on our fruit trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, we had the sea beach. The strand&mdash;there are three miles
      of it&mdash;is one of the glories of Ballyhaine. We did most of our
      manoeuvring there and dug our trenches there. Haines was opposed to this
      plan at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the Germans come at all," said Cotter, "they'll come from the sea.
      They must, this being an island."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Haines.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Cotter, "the beach is the place where we shall have to meet
      them, and the strand is where our trenches ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answering that argument. Even Haines gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With barbed wire entanglements," said Cotter, "down to the water's edge."
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather round about Christmas-time was extraordinarily severe in
      Ballyhaine. We came in for a series of gales, accompanied by driving rain,
      and the days at that time of year are so short that most of our soldiering
      had to be done in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got one cold after another, and so did every other member of the corps.
      Poor old Cotter limped pitifully on parade, but he did not say a word
      about rheumatism. The spirit of the men was splendid, and not one of us
      showed a sign of shirking, though Haines kept us at it with ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haines varied the digging by making us practise a horrible manoeuvre
      called "relieving trenches." This was always done in the middle of the
      night, between twelve and one o'clock. Part of the corps went out early&mdash;about
      10.30 p.m.&mdash;and manned the trenches. The rest of us marched forth at
      midnight and relieved them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst evening we had all winter was December 8th. It was blowing
      terrifically from the south-east The sea was tumbling in on the beach in
      enormous waves, fringing the whole line of the shore with a broad stretch
      of white foam. The rain swept over the country pitilessly. I came out of
      town by the 5.10 train, and called at the club on my way home. I found a
      notice posted up:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ballyhaine Veterans' Corps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tonight, December the 8th, trenches will be relieved at 12 midnight No. 1
      and No. 2 Platoons to parade at 10.30, march to north end of the strand,
      and occupy trenches."
    </p>
    <p>
      That meant a six-mile march for those platoons&mdash;three there and three
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. 3 and No. 4 Platoons to parade at 11 p.m., march to cliffs, descend
      rocks, and relieve trenches as soon as possible after midnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      I am in No. 3 Platoon, and I confess I shuddered. The rocks at the north
      end of the beach are abominably slippery. A year ago I should have
      hesitated about climbing down in broad daylight in the finest weather. My
      military training had done a good deal for me physically, but I still
      shrank from those rocks at midnight with a tempest howling round me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reached home I put a good face on the matter. I was not going to
      admit to my wife or Janet&mdash;particularly to Janet&mdash;that I was
      afraid of night operations in any weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please have my uniform left out for me," I said, "I shall put it on
      before dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely," said my wife, "you're not going out to-night? I don't think you
      ought to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Duty, my dear," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just fancy," said Janet, "if the Germans came and father wasn't there! We
      might be murdered in our beds!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sometimes not quite sure whether Janet means to scoff or is in
      serious earnest On this occasion I was inclined to think that she was
      poking fun at the Veterans' Corps. I frowned at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll get dreadfully wet," said my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the least harm in that," I said cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It'll give you another cold in your head," said Janet
    </p>
    <p>
      This time she was certainly sneering. I frowned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said my wife, "it won't matter to you. You're so strong and
      healthy. Nothing does you any harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      I suspected her of attempting a subtle form of flattery, but what she said
      was quite true. I am, for a man of fifty-three, extremely hardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking," she said, "of poor old Mr. Cotter. I don't think he ought
      to go. Mrs. Cotter was round here this afternoon. She says he's suffering
      dreadfully from rheumatism, though he won't admit it, and if he goes out
      to-night... But he's so determined, poor old dear. And she simply can't
      stop him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cotter," I said, "must stay at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he won't," said my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Military ardour is very strong in him," said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll ring up Dr. Tompkins," I said, "and tell him to forbid Cotter to go
      out Tompkins is Medical Officer of the corps, and has a right to give
      orders of the kind. In fact, it's his duty to see that the company's not
      weakened by ill-health."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid," said my wife, "that Dr. Tompkins can do nothing. Mrs. Cotter
      was with him before she came here. The fact is that Mr. Cotter won't give
      in even to the doctor's orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      I rang up Tompkins and put the case very strongly to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will simply kill Cotter," I said, "and we can't have that. He may not
      be of any very great military value, but he's a nice old boy, and we don't
      want to lose him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tompkins agreed with me thoroughly. He said he'd been thinking the matter
      over since Mrs. Cotter called on him in the afternoon, and had hit upon a
      plan which would meet the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If only the C.O. will fall in with it," he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haines is in some ways a difficult man. He likes to manage things his own
      way, and resents any suggestions made to him, particularly by men in the
      ranks. However, Cotter's life was at stake, so I undertook to tackle
      Haines, even at the risk of being snubbed. Tompkins explained his plan to
      me. I rang up Haines, and laid it before him. I put the matter very
      strongly to him. I even said that the War Office would probably deprive
      him of his command if it was discovered that he had been wasting the lives
      of his men unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The country needs us all," I said, "even Cotter. After all, Cotter is a
      non-commissioned officer and a most valuable man. Besides, it'll do the
      Ambulance Brigade a lot of good."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this last consideration which weighed most with Haines. He had felt
      for some time that our ambulance ladies were coming to have too good an
      opinion of themselves. I had the satisfaction of going back to the
      drawing-room and telling Janet that the stretcher bearers were to parade
      at eleven o'clock, and march in the rear of the column&mdash;Numbers 3 and
      4 Platoons&mdash;which went to relieve trenches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rot," said Janet "We can't possibly go out on a night like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "C.O.'s orders," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The stretchers will be utterly ruined," she said, "not to mention our
      hats."
    </p>
    <p>
      "C.O.'s orders," I said severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we must go," said Janet, "we'll take the ambulance waggon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you won't," I said. "You'll take your stretchers and carry them.
      Yours not to reason why, Janet And in any case you can't take the
      ambulance waggon, because we're marching along the beach, and you know
      perfectly well that the strand is simply scored with trenches. We can't
      have the ambulance waggon smashed up. It's the only one we have. If a few
      girls break their legs it doesn't much matter. There are too many girls
      about the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Platoons Numbers 1 and 2 marched off at 10.30 p.m. in a blinding downpour
      of rain. We watched them go from the porch of the golf pavilion, and
      promised to relieve them as quickly as we could. We paraded, according to
      orders, at 11 sharp, and I was glad to see that Janet and the other girls
      were wet and draggled long before we started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haines made us a short speech. He had to shout at the top of his voice
      because the storm was making a dreadful noise. But we heard what he said.
      The business of relieving trenches, he told us, would be carried out under
      strictly war conditions, precisely as if enemy submarines were shelling us
      from the sea. There would necessarily, supposing the submarines to be
      actually there, be casualties in our force. Haines told off four men to
      act as casualties. The first on the list&mdash;this was the way Tompkins'
      plan worked out&mdash;was Corporal Cotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corporal Cotter," said Haines, "will drop out of the ranks as the column
      passes the third bathing-box, numbering from the south end of the beach,
      Mrs. Tompkins' bathing-box, which is painted bright green."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haines was, very properly, most particular about defining the bathing-box
      exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corporal Cotter and the other casualties," said Haines, "will take
      waterproof ground-sheets with them&mdash;two waterproof ground-sheets each&mdash;and
      keep as dry as possible. The stretcher bearers will follow the column at a
      distance of two hundred paces to pick up the casualties, affording
      first-aid on the spot, and, on reaching the field hospital, will apply
      restoratives under the directions of the Company's Medical Officer. For
      the purposes of these manouvres. Corporal Cotter's house will be regarded
      as the Field Hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other three casualties, all elderly and rather delicate men, were
      ordered to drop out of the ranks at places further along the beach. If it
      was Janet's luck to reach the furthest casualty she would walk, carrying a
      stretcher, about a mile and a half altogether. When she got home she would
      be less inclined to sneer at people who catch cold in the service of their
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was extremely dark. I do not think I have ever experienced a
      darker night. We could hear the sea roaring on our left, and could see,
      when we looked back, a dim glow here and there from the windows of our
      houses; but it was quite impossible to see anything on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      I missed Cotter when we had been stumbling along for about a quarter of an
      hour, and felt glad that he had done his share. In a minute or so, I
      hoped, he would be safe on a stretcher, and half an hour later would be
      drinking whisky and water, hot That, so Tompkins told me, was the
      restorative which was to be administered to all the casualties.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got through the business of relieving the trenches in the end, though
      we had a tough struggle. The great difficulty was to find them. If
      Platoons Numbers 1 and 2 could have shouted to us or flashed their
      electric torches we should have got them much sooner than we did. But
      noise and light were strictly forbidden. They would, so Haines said,
      attract the enemy's fire, and result in our being wiped out by shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got separated at one time from the rest of my platoon, and walked into
      the sea twice. Afterwards I fell over the Company Sergeant-Major, who was
      sitting in a pool beside a rock. He said he had sprained his ankle. But
      that turned out not to be true. He had only twisted it a little, and was
      able to limp home. In civil life our Company Sergeant-Major is one of the
      directors of the Corporate Banking Company Ltd., and drives into town in
      his own motor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I came on Haines, wandering by himself on a sandhill. He was swearing
      viciously. It was, indeed, the sound of his oaths which led me to him.
      They were not loud, but they were uttered with an intensity which gave
      them the power of piercing through the tumult of the storm. He and I and
      the Company Sergeant-Major stuck together, and at 1 a.m.&mdash;we took the
      time from Haines' luminous-faced wrist watch&mdash;we suddenly tumbled
      into the trench.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found the whole four platoons waiting for us; but they would not have
      waited much longer. The senior Second Lieutenant&mdash;a very well-known
      solicitor&mdash;had taken command of the company, assuming, as he said,
      that Haines had become a casualty accidentally. His idea was to march the
      men home, and then send the Ambulance Brigade to search for Haines, the
      Company Sergeant-Major, and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the sort of thing," he said, "an ambulance is for. The men in the
      fighting line can't be expected to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      We marched home in pretty good order, considering that we were all very
      wet, greatly exhausted, and many of us bruised in various parts of our
      bodies. Our spirit was quite unbroken, and Haines, writing up the official
      diary afterwards, said that our moral was excellent. He did us no more
      than bare justice. There was not a man among us&mdash;except perhaps the
      Company Sergeant-Major, whose ankle was swelling up&mdash;who would not
      have welcomed a German attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got back to the golf pavilion, and found the whole place in an uproar.
      Women, all of them very wet, were rushing about. Tompkins was giving
      confused and contradictory orders to the twelve stretcher bearers, who
      looked cowed and miserable. Mrs. Cotter was sitting on the floor in a
      corner of the room crying bitterly. We got the explanation out of Tompkins
      at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three of the casualties had, it appeared, been successfully picked up and
      carried home. The stretcher bearers had somehow missed Cotter. Search
      parties had been sent out Tompkins himself had felt his way round each of
      the fifteen bathing-boxes. The nursing section of the Ambulance Brigade
      had waved electric torches and stable lanterns up and down the beach from
      the edge of the sea to the sandhills. The stretcher bearers, scourged by
      the remarks Tompkins made about their incompetence, had gone shouting
      through the storm until they were hoarse and utterly exhausted. Nothing
      had been seen or heard of Cotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haines took charge of the situation at once. He formed up the four
      platoons, and marched us all back to the beach. There we assumed open
      order, and skirmished in a northerly direction. We were told to keep in
      touch with each other, and to leave no square yard of the sand unexamined.
      We were to go on skirmishing until we found Cotter, dead or alive. My own
      idea was that if we found anything it would be his corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did my best to obey orders, but I almost immediately lost touch with
      everybody else. The other men, so I learnt afterwards, had the same
      experience. However, I had the good luck to find Cotter. He came towards
      me, indeed he ran into me before I saw him. He was in charge of a
      policeman, who held him firmly but kindly by the arm. The moment Cotter
      saw me he burst out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell this infernal fool that I'm not drunk," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you're acquainted with the gentleman," said the policeman, "it would
      be well for you to take him home to his bed. He's not in a fit state to be
      out by himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      I drove off the policeman with some difficulty, making myself personally
      responsible for Cotter's safety. Then I questioned the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you been doing?" I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Waiting for the ambulance. I'd be waiting still if that ass of a
      policeman hadn't insisted that I was drunk and dragged me away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord!" I said, "and they've been looking for you for hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that," said Cotter. "I saw their lights all over the place and
      heard them shouting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why on earth didn't you shout back and let them know where you
      were?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Casualties don't shout," said Cotter. "They can't They're too weak. I
      groaned occasionally; but I suppose they didn't hear me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how long did you mean to lie out in this storm?" I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Till the stretcher bearers found me," said Cotter. "Those were the C.O.'s
      orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know whether any medals will be given to volunteers after the
      war. Cotter certainly deserves one. I have never heard a finer story of
      devotion to duty than his. When I had got rid of the policeman he actually
      wanted to go back and lie down again.

    <h2>
      II ~~ GETTING EVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The battalion awaited its orders to embark for France. A feeling of
      expectation, a certain nervousness, a half-pleasurable excitement,
      prevailed in the officers' mess and among the men. No one thought of
      service in France as a picnic, or anticipated a good time in the trenches.
      But there was a general sense of relief that the period of training&mdash;a
      long, tiresome, very dull business&mdash;was over at last over or almost
      over. For the Colonel and certain remote authorities behind the Colonel
      believed in working the battalion hard up to the last moment. Therefore
      day after day there were "stunts" and "shows," field exercises of every
      conceivable kind. The weather was hot, as hot as weather ought to be in
      the first week of August Long marches became dusty horrors to the men.
      Manouvres meant hours of desperate toil. Officers thought longingly of
      bygone summers, of the cool shade of trees, of tennis played in white
      flannels, of luscious plates of strawberries and cream. The Colonel, an
      old soldier, went on inventing new "stunts" and more of them. He had
      laboured at the training of his battalion, hammering raw boys into
      disciplined men, inspiring subalterns with something of his own spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole he had been successful. The men sweated, but grumbled very
      little. The officers kept up a gallant pretence at keenness. Slackness was
      regarded as bad form, and only one member of the mess made no secret of
      his opinion that the Colonel was overdoing the "spit and polish" business.
      This was McMahon, the medical officer; and he did not, properly speaking,
      belong to the battalion at all. Men and officers alike were drawn for the
      most part from the English midlands. McMahon was an Irishman. They were
      born with a sense of discipline and the Colonel worked on material
      responsive to his methods. McMahon, like most Irishmen, was by temperament
      a rebel. Yet there was no more popular officer than the Irish doctor. His
      frank good humour, his ready wit, his unfailing kindliness, won him
      affection. Even the Colonel liked him, and bore from McMahon behaviour
      which would have led to the sharp snubbing of anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a day&mdash;the 6th of August&mdash;for which the Colonel, or
      some higher authority, devised a "stunt" of the most intense and laborious
      kind. A very great and remote man, the General in command of the whole
      district, promised to be present and to witness the performance. Orders
      were issued in minute detail, and every officer was expected to be
      familiar with them. Maps were studied conscientiously. Field glasses were
      polished. Rations were served out Kits were inspected. The affair was an
      attack upon a hill supposed to be strongly held by an enemy well provided
      with machine-guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      A genuine excitement possessed the battalion. This, so it was felt, was
      very like the real thing. Just so, some day in France, would an advance be
      made and great glory won. McMahon alone remained cheerfully indifferent to
      the energetic fussiness which prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day dawned cloudless with promise of intense heat. Very early, after a
      hurried and insufficient breakfast, B Company marched out It was the
      business of B Company to take up a position south of the enemy's hill, to
      harass the foe with flanking fire and at the proper moment to rush certain
      machine-gun posts. B Company had some ten miles to march before reaching
      its appointed place. McMahon gave it as his opinion that B Company would
      be incapable of rushing anything when it had marched ten miles in
      blistering heat and had lain flat for an hour or two in a shadeless field.
      A party of cooks, with a travelling kitchen, followed B Company. McMahon
      said that if the cooks were sensible men they would lose their way and
      come to a halt in a wood, not far from a stream. He added that he was
      himself very sensible and had already fixed on the wood, about a mile from
      the scene of the attack, where he intended to spend the day, with a novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other three companies, the Lewis gunners, and a battery of Stokes gun
      men, attached to the battalion for the attack, marched out later, under
      the command of the Colonel himself. Cyclist scouts scoured the roads ahead
      of the advance. McMahon, accompanied by an orderly, marched in the rear
      and complained greatly of the dust. A Brigadier appeared in a motor and
      cast a critical eye on the men. Two officers in staff caps, understood to
      be umpires, rode by.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon, the heat being then very great, a motor cyclist dashed up, his
      machine snorting horribly, the man himself plastered with dust, sweat and
      oil. He announced that the battalion was under heavy fire from the enemy
      artillery and that men were falling fast The Brigadier had sent an urgent
      message to that effect. The Colonel, who rather expected that something of
      the sort would occur, gave the orders necessary in such a situation. The
      men opened out into artillery formation and advanced, by a series of short
      rushes, to take cover in some trenches, supposed to have been abandoned,
      very conveniently, by the enemy the day before. The Brigadier, seated in
      his motor-car in a wood on a neighbouring hill, watched the operation
      through his field glasses, munched a sandwich, and enjoyed a glass of
      sherry from his flask. McMahon, for whom short rushes in artillery
      formation had no attractions at all, slipped through a hedge, skirted a
      field of ripening oats, and settled himself very comfortably under a beech
      tree on the edge of a small wood. His orderly followed him and laid down a
      large package on the grass beside the doctor. The Colonel, an enthusiastic
      realist, had insisted that McMahon should bring with him a supply of
      surgical instruments, dressings and other things necessary for dealing
      with wounds. McMahon opened the package. He took out a novel, a tin of
      tobacco, a great many packages of cigarettes, two bottles of soda water,
      two lemons and several parcels of food.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," he said to the orderly, "is the advanced dressing station. When
      the casualties begin to arrive, we shall be ready for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brigadier sent another motor cyclist to say that the battalion would
      be wiped out if it stayed where it was. He suggested a move to the right
      and an attempt to get into touch with B Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brigadier, though he drove in a motor-car, was feeling the heat. If a
      direct advance had been made on the hill from where the battalion lay he
      would have been obliged to drive out of his wood in order to keep the
      battle in view. A move to the right could be watched comfortably from
      where he sat The Colonel explained the situation, not the Brigadier's
      feelings, to his officers, exposing himself with reckless gallantry as he
      passed from company to company. He said that he himself would survey the
      ground to the right and would try to discover the exact position of B
      Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall," he said to the Adjutant, "climb a tree so as to get a good
      view."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Adjutant remonstrated. He thought the Colonel was too old a man for
      climbing trees. He recommended that a subaltern, a Second Lieutenant whom
      nobody would miss much if he fell, should be sent up the tree. The
      suggestion, as the Adjutant might have guessed, made the Colonel more
      determined and slightly exasperated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave orders that the Stokes gunners should shell the enemy while he
      climbed the tree. The Stokes gunners did not want to shell anyone. Their
      weapons are awkward to handle and their ammunition very heavy. They were
      already as hot as any men ought to be. But they were well trained and
      highly disciplined. They attacked the enemy with small dummy shells, which
      rose gently into the air, made a half-circle, and fell about fifteen yards
      from the muzzles of their guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, looking about him for a tree not too difficult to climb,
      caught sight of the beech under which McMahon lay. It seemed exactly the
      kind of tree he required. It was high. Its lower branches were close to
      the ground. It looked strong and sound. The Colonel pushed his way through
      the hedge, avoided the oats, and approached the tree across a pasture
      field. He came on McMahon stretched flat on his back, a tumbler full of
      lemon squash beside him and his novel in his hand. The Colonel was still
      irritated by the Adjutant's suggestion that he was too old to climb trees.
      He was also beginning, now that he was near a tree, to wonder uneasily
      whether the Adjutant had not been right He saw an opportunity of
      expressing his feelings at the expense of McMahon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing here?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      McMahon, who had not seen the Colonel approach, stood up hurriedly,
      upsetting his lemon squash, and saluting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the deuce are you doing here?" said the Colonel. "You've no business
      to be idling, drinking and smoking under a tree, when the battalion is in
      action."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is an advanced dressing station, sir," said McMahon. "I'm waiting
      for the casualties.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not your duty," said the Colonel. "Your duty is to be with the
      men, in the firing line, ready to render first aid when required."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg pardon, sir," said McMahon, "but I don't think that you're quite
      right in saying&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to tell me," said the Colonel, "that it isn't the duty of a
      medical officer to accompany the men into the firing line?"
    </p>
    <p>
      McMahon saluted again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "According to the instructions issued by the R.A.M.C., sir," he said, "my
      place is in the advanced dressing station when there's only one medical
      officer attached to the unit in action. If there is more than one the
      position is, of course, quite different."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, though a soldier of long experience, was not at all sure what
      instructions the R.A.M.C. authorities might have issued to their officers.
      And doctors are a powerful faction, given to standing together and defying
      anyone who attempts to interfere with them. Besides, no one, not even the
      strongest and healthiest of us, knows how soon he may find himself under
      the power of a doctor, seized with a pain or other form of discomfort
      which only a doctor can alleviate. It is never wise to push things to a
      quarrel with any member of the R.A.M.C.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel turned away and, somewhat laboriously, climbed his tree. He
      was anxious, if possible, to make McMahon do a little work. It was
      annoying to think that this young man, horribly addicted to slacking,
      should be lying on his back in the shade. Yet he did not at once see his
      way to any plan for making McMahon run about in the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while he scanned the position of B Company through his field
      glasses that an idea suddenly occurred to him. He climbed down rapidly and
      found McMahon standing respectfully to attention at the foot of the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told me, I think," said the Colonel, "that this is the advanced
      dressing station?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that you're prepared to deal with casualties?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall send some casualties down to you," said the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall expect," said the Colonel, "that each man shall be properly
      treated, exactly as if he were really wounded, bandaged up, you know,
      ready for the ambulance to take him to the casualty clearing station. And
      a proper record must be kept for each case. You must have a list made out
      for me, properly classified, with a note of the treatment adopted in each
      case and the nature of the injury, just as if you were going to send it to
      the medical officer at the casualty clearing station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it must be done properly," said the Colonel. "No shirking. No short
      cuts. I don't see why you shouldn't practise your job like the rest of
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away with a smile, a grim but well-satisfied smile. He intended
      to keep McMahon busy, very busy indeed, for the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      McMahon lay down again after the Colonel left him. But he did not attempt
      to read his novel. He saw through the Colonel's plan. He was determined to
      defeat it if he could. He was enjoying a peaceful afternoon, and had no
      intention of exhausting himself bandaging up men who had nothing the
      matter with them or compiling long lists of imaginary injuries. After five
      minutes' thought he hit upon a scheme. Ten minutes later the first
      casualty arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sent to the rear by the Colonel, sir," said the man. "Orders are to
      report to you. Shrapnel wound in the left thigh, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Left thigh?" said McMahon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the left the Colonel said, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said McMahon. "Orderly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The orderly, who had found a comfortable couch among some bracken, roused
      himself and stood to attention in front of McMahon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take this man round to the far side of the tree," said McMahon, "and let
      him lie down there flat on his back. You can give him a cigarette, He is
      to stay there until he gets orders to leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      The orderly saluted. The man grinned. He was quite ready to lie under the
      tree without attempting to move until someone ordered him to get up.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the next ten minutes six more casualties arrived. Their
      injuries were of several different kinds. One man reported that his thumb
      had been taken off by a machine-gun bullet Another said he had a scalp
      wound A third had lost a whole leg, severed at the thigh. A fourth had a
      fragment of shell in his stomach. A fifth was completely blinded. A sixth
      was suffering from gas poisoning. McMahon's treatment never varied. Each
      man was given a cigarette and led off by the orderly to lie down in the
      shade at the far side of the tree. McMahon kept quite cool, refreshed
      himself occasionally with a drink of lemon squash, and smoked his pipe. He
      began to admire the activity of the Colonel's imagination. For two hours
      casualties poured in and every one had a different kind of wound. There
      was scarcely any part of the human body with which McMahon was not called
      upon to deal And the Colonel never once repeated himself. Before four
      o'clock about a third of the battalion and half of the officers were
      lying, very well content, in the shade under McMahon's care. Many of them
      were sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orderly was a man with a sense of military propriety. He insisted on
      the casualties lying in straight rows, as neatly aligned as if they were
      on their feet at parade in the barrack square. At last the stream of
      wounded grew slacker and finally ceased to flow. Between half-past four
      and five o'clock not a single man came to report himself wounded. McMahon,
      lighting a fresh pipe, congratulated himself. Either the Colonel's
      knowledge of anatomy was exhausted and he was unable to think of any more
      wounds, or the battle was over, and there was no further excuse for
      inventing casualties. McMahon got up and stretched himself. He handed his
      novel, the two empty soda-water bottles, and his tobacco tin to the
      orderly, and bade him pack them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No cigarettes left, I suppose?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, not one. In fact, sir, the last twenty men didn't get any.
      Weren't enough to go round them all, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said McMahon, "it's been an expensive afternoon for me; but I don't
      grudge it Those poor fellows wanted a smoke and a rest badly. Besides,
      I've had a very pleasant time, pleasant and peaceful."
    </p>
    <p>
      He strolled round to the far side of the tree and took a look at the men
      who lay stretched out. One of the officers, a boy of untiring energy,
      complained that he was bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, McMahon, can't I get up and go back to the mess? What's the good
      of my lying here all the afternoon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll lie there," said McMahon severely, "until you get orders to go.
      And it may be a long time before you do. In fact, you won't be able to.
      stir till the padre comes, and I haven't the least idea where he is, I
      doubt if he's out with us at all to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the dickens has the padre got to do with it?" said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll find that out in time. For the present you've nothing to do but
      lie still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But hang it all&mdash;&mdash; I say, McMahon, can't you finish off and
      let me go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?" said McMahon. "I've finished with you long ago. There's nothing more
      for me to do. The next man to take you in hand is the padre."
    </p>
    <p>
      The orderly stood at his elbow while he spoke. He seemed a little nervous
      and agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg pardon, sir," he said. "The Colonel's just coming, sir. He and the
      General. He's drove up in the General's car; and I'm afraid they're both
      coming here, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      McMahon turned. What the orderly said was perfectly true. The Colonel, and
      with him the General, and the two umpires in the fight, were skirting the
      oats and making for the little grove of trees where the casualties were.
    </p>
    <p>
      McMahon went to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, McMahon," said the Colonel, "I've come to see how you've treated the
      wounded. I've brought the General with me. Casualties rather heavy, eh?
      Had a busy afternoon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel grinned. McMahon saluted respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got your list made out?" said the Colonel, "and your report on each case?
      Just hand them over to me, will you? The General would like to see them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, sir," said McMahon, "but have you given orders for the
      padre to report here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Padre?" said the Colonel. "What do you want the padre for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The padre and a burying party, sir," said McMahon. "The fact is, sir,
      that the wounded all died, every one of them, on the way down from the
      firing line. Arrived here stone dead. I couldn't do anything for them,
      sir. Dead before they got to me. I've had them laid out, if you'd like to
      see them, sir. It's all I could do for the poor fellows. It's the padre's
      job now. I understand that he keeps a register of burials, so there was no
      need for me to make a list, and of course I didn't attempt any treatment.
      It wouldn't have been any use, sir, when the men were dead."

    <h2>
      III ~~ A MATTER OF DISCIPLINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      O'Byrne, the Reverend Timothy, is our padre. We call him Tim behind his
      back because we like him and Padre to his face because some respect is due
      to his profession. Mackintosh is our medical officer. The Reverend Tim
      used to take a special delight in teasing Mackintosh. It may have been the
      natural antipathy, the cat and dog feeling, which exists between parsons
      and doctors. I do not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the padre never lost a chance of pulling the doctor's leg, and
      Mackintosh spent hours proving that the things which the padre says he saw
      could not possibly have happened I should not like to call any padre a
      liar; but some of the Rev. Tim's stories were rather tall, and the
      doctor's scepticism always goaded him to fresh flights of imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mess was a much livelier place after the Rev. Tim joined it. Before he
      attached himself to us we used to wonder why God made men like Mackintosh,
      and what use they are in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we know. Mackintosh exists to call out all that is best in our padre.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night&mdash;the battalion was back resting at the time&mdash;we had an
      Assistant Provost Marshal as a guest The conversation turned on the
      subject of deserters, and our A.P.M. told us some curious stories about
      the attempts made by these poor devils to escape the net of the military
      organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is," said the A.P.M., "that a deserter hasn't a dog's chance,
      not here in France anyway. We are bound to get him every time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not every time," said the padre. "I know one who has been at large for
      months and you'll never lay hands on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The A.P.M., who did not of course know our padre, sat up and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think it's his fault that he's a deserter," said the padre. "He
      was forced into it And anyway, even if I give you his name and tell you
      exactly where he is, you'll not arrest him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he's a deserter, I will," said the A.P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you won't," said the padre. "Excuse my contradicting you, but when
      you hear the story you'll see yourself that you can't arrest the man.
      Mackintosh here is protecting him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it me?" said Mackintosh. "I'd like you to be careful what you're
      saying. In my opinion it's libellous to say that I'm protecting a
      deserter. I'll have you court-martialled, Mr. O'Byrne, padre or no padre.
      I'll have you court-martialled if you bring any such accusation against
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean you personally," said O'Byrne. "I am taking you as a
      representative of your profession. The man I am speaking of"&mdash;he
      turned politely to the A.P.M.&mdash;"is under the direct protection of the
      Army Medical. You can't get at him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mackintosh bristled, to the padre's great delight Anything in the way of
      an attack on the medical profession excites Mackintosh fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Binny is the man's name," said the padre. "17932, Private Alfred Binny.
      He was in the Wessex, before the hospital people made a deserter of him. I
      will give you his address if you like, but you'll not be able to arrest
      him. If you try you'll have every doctor in France down on you. They back
      each other up through anything, don't they, Mackintosh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like you to understand," said Mackintosh, "that you can't be saying
      things like that with impunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get on with the story, padre," I said, "and don't exasperate Mackintosh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was while I was attached to No. 97 General Hospital," he said. "Know
      No. 97, Mackintosh? No. That's a pity. It's a place which would just suit
      you. Patients wakened every morning at five to have their faces washed.
      Discipline polished till you could see your face in it, and so many rules
      and regulations that you can't cross a room without tripping over one. The
      lists and card indexes that are kept going in that place, and the forms
      that are filled in! You'd glory in it, Mackintosh. But it didn't suit my
      temperament."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you," said Mackintosh grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was while I was there," said the padre, "that Biimy came down the line
      and was admitted to the hospital with a cushy wound in the fleshy part of
      his arm. He'd have been well in three weeks and back with his battalion in
      a month, if it hadn't been for the doctors. It's entirely owing to them
      that he's a deserter now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malingered, I suppose," said Mackintosh. "Got back to England by shamming
      shell shock and was given his discharge. He wouldn't have pulled it off if
      I'd been there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've guessed wrong," said the padre. "It wasn't a case of malingering.
      As nearly as possible it was the exact opposite. The doctors tried to make
      the poor fellow out much worse than he really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it," said Mackintosh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact," said the padre, "the mistake&mdash;you'll hardly
      deny that it was a mistake when you hear the story&mdash;arose through too
      strict attention to discipline, that and the number of lists and returns
      that were made out. It doesn't do to rely too much on lists, and there is
      such a thing as overdoing discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What happened was this. One evening, when Binny had been in the hospital
      about a week, two orderlies came to his bed with a stretcher. They told
      him they were going to carry him down to the mortuary and put him into his
      coffin. Binny, of course, thought they were making some new kind of joke,
      and laughed. But the orderlies were perfectly serious. They said his name
      was on the list of those who had died during the day and they had no
      choice except to obey orders and put him into a coffin. They showed Binny
      the list, all nicely typed out, and there was no mistake about it Binny's
      name, number, regiment, and religion were all there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Binny began to get indignant. He said he wasn't dead, that anyone could
      see he wasn't dead, and that it would be a barbarous thing to bury him.
      The orderlies, who were very nice fellows, admitted that Binny seemed to
      be alive, but they stuck to it that it was their business to carry out
      their orders. Into the mortuary Binny would have to go. They tried to
      console him by saying that the funeral would not be till the next morning.
      But that did not cheer Binny much. In the end they took pity on the poor
      fellow and said they would go away for an hour and come back. If Binny
      could get the order changed they'd be very pleased to leave him where he
      was. It wasn't, so they explained, any pleasure to them to put Binny into
      a coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Binny did not get much chance during his hour's reprieve. The only person
      who came into the ward was a V.A.D. girl, quite a nice little girl,
      good-looking enough to be bullied a lot by the sister-in-charge. Binny
      told her about the fix he was in, and at first she thought he was raving
      and tried to soothe him down. In the end, to pacify him, I suppose, she
      went and asked the orderlies about him. She had not been out in France
      long, that V.A.D., and wasn't properly accustomed to things. When she
      found out that what Binny had told her was true, she got fearfully
      excited. She couldn't do anything herself, of course, but she ran off to
      the matron as hard as she could. The matron was a bit startled just at
      first, but she kept her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tell Private Binny,' she said, 'that if he has any complaints to make
      they must be made at the proper time and through the proper channels. The
      C.O. goes round the hospital every morning between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.
      Private Binny can speak to him then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But by that time,' said the V. A.D. girl, 'the man will be buried.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I can't help that,' said the matron.' The discipline of the hospital
      must be maintained. It would be perfectly impossible to run a place like
      this if every man was allowed to make complaints at all hours of the day
      and to all sorts of people.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "That V.A.D. was a plucky girl, and persistent&mdash;they sent her home
      afterwards in disgrace&mdash;and she talked on until the matron agreed to
      take a look at Binny. I think she was staggered when she saw him sitting
      up in bed and heard him cursing the orderlies, who had come back by that
      time. But she couldn't do anything. She wasn't really a bad sort of woman,
      and I don't suggest for a moment that she wanted to have Binny buried
      alive. But she had no authority. She could not alter an order. And there
      the thing was in black and white. However, she persuaded the orderlies to
      wait another half-hour. She went off and found one of the surgeons. He was
      a decent sort of fellow, but young, and he didn't see his way to
      interfering. There had been several mistakes made in that hospital, and
      the C.O. had been rather heavily strafed, which meant of course that
      everyone under him was strafed worse, on the good old principle of passing
      it on. That surgeon's idea was to avoid trouble, if possible. Somebody, he
      said, had made a mistake, but it was too late, then, to set things right,
      and the best thing to do was to say nothing about it. He was sorry for
      Binny, but he couldn't do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the V.A.D. girl heard that, she lost her temper. She said she'd
      write home and tell her father about it, and that her father was a Member
      of Parliament and would raise hell about it She didn't, of course, say
      hell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She couldn't do that," said Mackintosh. "The censor wouldn't pass a
      letter with a story like that in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right," said the padre, "and it wouldn't have been any good if her
      father had got the letter. He couldn't have done anything. If he'd asked a
      question in Parliament he'd simply have been told a lie of some kind. It
      was a silly sort of threat to make. The V.A.D. saw that herself and began
      to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That upset the surgeon so much that he went round and took a look at
      Binny. The man was pale by that time and in the deuce of a funk. But he
      wasn't in the least dead. The surgeon felt that it was a hard case, and
      said he'd take the risk of speaking to the C.O. about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The C.O. of No. 97 General at that time was an oldish man, who suffered
      from suppressed gout, which is the regular medical name for unsuppressed
      temper. He said emphatically that Private Binny was reported dead, marked
      dead, removed from the hospital books, and must stay dead. The whole
      system of the R.A.M.C. would break down, he said, and things would drift
      into chaos if dead men were allowed to come to life again whenever they
      chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The surgeon was a plucky young fellow in his way. Remembering how pretty
      the V.A.D. looked when she cried, he pressed Binny's case on the C.O. The
      old gentleman said he might have done something two hours sooner; but the
      hospital returns had gone to the D.D.M.S. and couldn't possibly be got
      back again or altered. In the end, after a lot more talk about regulations
      and discipline, he said he'd telephone to the D.D.M.S. office and see if
      anything could be done. It is greatly to his credit that he did telephone,
      explaining the case as well as he could over a faulty wire. The staff
      colonel in the office was perfectly civil, but said that the returns had
      been forwarded by a motor dispatch rider to G.H.Q. and could not be
      recalled by any possibility. The C.O., who seems to have begun to realize
      the horrible position of Binny, asked advice as to what he ought to do.
      The staff colonel said he'd never come across a case of the kind before,
      but it seemed plain to him that Binny was dead, that is to say, officially
      dead. The Chaplain's Department, he thought, might be able to do something
      for a man after he was dead. If not nobody could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," said O'Byrne with a smile, "is where I came in. The C.O. sent for
      me at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose," said Mackintosh, "that you straightened the whole thing out
      without difficulty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mackintosh is always irritated at a suggestion that anyone connected with
      the medical profession can possibly make a mistake. When irritated he is
      apt to attempt a kind of heavy sarcasm which O'Byrne sucks in with obvious
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the padre, "I couldn't straighten it out. But I did the best I
      could. I went to see poor Binny. He was in the mortuary by that time. I
      found him sitting up in his coffin crying like a child. I comforted him as
      well as I could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor devil," said Mackintosh. "Not that I believe a word of this story.
      It couldn't have happened. But you may as well go on and tell us what you
      did. Sang hymns to him, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said the padre. "I got him something to eat and a couple of
      blankets. That mortuary is a cold place, and, though you mightn't think
      it, a coffin is draughty. Next morning I buried him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless me!" said the A.P.M. explosively. "Do you mean to say you
      buried a man you knew to be alive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't help it," said the padre. "It was in orders, matter of
      discipline, you know. Can't go back on discipline, can you, Mackintosh? I
      got through it as quickly as I decently could. Then I let Binny out The
      graves in that cemetery are never filled in for an hour or two after the
      coffins are let down, so I had lots of time. Jolly glad poor Binny was to
      get out. He said he'd shivered all over when he heard 'The Last Post.' I
      had a suit of clothes for him; of course, civilian clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The padre filled himself a glass of whisky and soda and lit his pipe. He
      looked round with a smile of triumph. Most of us applauded him. He
      deserved it The story was one of his best imaginative efforts. I suppose
      the applause encouraged him to go further.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give you his address if you like," he said to the A.P.M. "He's
      working on a French farm and quite happy. But I don't see that you can
      possibly arrest him without getting the whole medical profession on your
      back. They said he was dead, you see, and, as Mackintosh will tell you,
      they never own up to making mistakes."

    <h2>
      IV ~~ THE SECOND BASS
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Be careful, Bates," said Miss Willmot; "we don't want your neck broken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No fear, miss," said Lance-Corporal Bates; "I'm all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lance-Corporal Bates had three gold bars on the sleeve of his tunic. He
      might fairly be reckoned a man of courage. His position, when Miss Willmot
      spoke to him, demanded nerve. He stood on the top rail of the back of a
      chair, a feeble-looking chair. The chair was placed on a table which was
      inclined to wobble, because one of its legs was half an inch shorter than
      the other three. Sergeant O'Rorke, leaning on the table, rested most of
      his weight on the seat of the chair, thereby balancing Bates and
      preventing an upset. Miss Willmot sat on the corner of the table, so that
      it wobbled very little. Bates, perilously balanced, hammered a nail, the
      last necessary nail, into the wall through the topmost ray of a large
      white star. Then he crept cautiously down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing beside Miss Willmot he surveyed the star.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looks a bit like Christmas, don't it, miss?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The glitters on it," said Sergeant O'Rorke, "is the beautifullest that
      ever was seen. The diamonds on the King's Crown wouldn't be finer."
    </p>
    <p>
      The star hung on the wall of the canteen opposite the counter. It was made
      of cotton wool pasted on cardboard. The wool had been supplied by a
      sympathetic nurse from a neighbouring hospital. It was looted from the
      medical stores. The frosting, which excited Sergeant O'Rorke's admiration,
      was done with sugar. It was Miss Nelly Davis, youngest and merriest of
      Miss Willmot's helpers, who suggested the sugar, when the powdered glass
      ordered from England failed to arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There can't be any harm in using it," she said. "What we're getting now
      isn't sugar at all, it is fine gravel. A stone of it wouldn't sweeten a
      single urn of tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Willmot took the sugar from her stores as she accepted the looted
      cotton-wool, without troubling to search for excuse or justification. She
      was a lady of strong will. When she made up her mind that the Christmas
      decorations of her canteen were to be the best in France she was not
      likely to stick at trifling breaches of regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round her with an expression of justifiable satisfaction. The
      long hut which served as a canteen looked wonderfully gay. Underneath the
      white star ran an inscription done in large letters made of ivy leaves.
      Miss Willmot, in the course of two years' service in the canteen of a base
      camp, had gained some knowledge of the soldier's heart Her inscription was
      calculated to make an immediate appeal. "A Merry Christmas," it ran, "And
      the Next in Blighty." The walls of the hut were hung round with festoons
      of coloured paper. Other festoons, red, blue, and green stretched across
      the room from wall to wall under the low ceiling. Chinese lanterns,
      swinging on wires, threatened the head of anyone more than six feet in
      height Sergeant O'Rorke, an Irish Guardsman until a wound lamed him, now a
      member of the camp police force, had to dodge the Chinese lanterns when he
      walked about Jam-pots and cigarette-tins, swathed in coloured paper, held
      bunches of holly and sprigs of mistletoe. They stood on the tables and the
      window sills.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the counter was the crowning glory of the canteen. In the middle of it
      stood an enormous Christmas cake, sugar-covered, bedecked with flags.
      Round the cake, built into airy castles, were hundreds of crackers. Huge
      dishes, piled high with mince pies, stood in rows along the whole length
      of the counter on each side of the cake. Behind them, rising to the height
      of five steps, was a long staircase made of packets of cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, it's grand," said Sergeant O'Rorke; "and there isn't one only
      yourself, miss, who'd do all you be doing for the men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Willmot's eyes softened. They were keen, grey eyes, not often given
      to expressing tender feeling. At home in the old days men spoke of her as
      a good sport, who rode straight and played the game; but they seldom tried
      to make love to her. Women said she was a dear, and that it was a thousand
      pities she did not marry. It was no sentimental recollection of bygone
      Christmases which brought the look of softness into her eyes. She was
      thinking that next day the men for once would feast to the full in the
      canteen&mdash;eat, drink, smoke, without paying a penny. She knew how well
      they deserved all she could do for them, these men who had done so much,
      borne so much, who still had so much to do and bear. Miss Willmot thanked
      God as she stood there that she had money to spend for the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tea! tea! tea! Tea's ready. Come along, Miss Willmot."
    </p>
    <p>
      The call came from behind the counter. Miss Nelly Davis stood there, a
      tall, fair girl in a long blue overall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've made toast and buttered it, and Mr. Digby's waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening, miss, and a happy Christmas to you," said Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there's a happy Christmas going these times at all," said Sergeant
      O'Rorke, "it's yourself deserves it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, thank you both," said Miss Willmot "If it hadn't been for your
      help I'd never have got the decorations done at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men left the hut, and Miss Willmot locked the door behind them. The
      canteen was closed until it opened in all its glory on Christmas
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed through a door at the back of the counter, slipped off her
      overall, stained and creased after a long day's work, then she went into
      the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nelly Davis was bending over a packing-case which stood in the middle
      of the kitchen floor. It served as a table, and she was spreading a cloth
      on it In front of the stove stood a young man in uniform, wearing the
      badges of a fourth class Chaplain to the Forces. This was Mr. Digby. Once
      he had been the popular curate of St Ethelburga's, the most fashionable of
      London churches. In those days Miss Willmot would have treated him with
      scorn. She did not care for curates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he was a fellow-worker in the Camp. His waterproof hung dripping
      behind the kitchen door. Drops of rain ran down his gaiters. He was trying
      to dry the knees of his breeches before the stove. Miss Willmot greeted
      him warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terrific night," he said; "rain coming down in buckets. Water running
      round the camp in rivers. I say, Miss Davis, you'll have to get out
      another cup. The Major's coming to tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There isn't a fourth cup," said Miss Nelly. "You'll have to drink out of
      a mug."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right-o! Mugs hold more, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All padres are greedy," said Miss Nelly. "What's bringing the Major
      here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've arranged a practice of the Christmas carols," said Digby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bother your old carols," said Miss Nelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must have a practice," said Digby. "You and Miss Willmot are all right;
      but the Major is frightfully shaky over the bass. It won't do to break
      down to-morrow. By the way, Miss Willmot, there's something I want to
      speak to you about before the Major comes. There's&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before the Major comes, Nelly," said Miss Willmot, "give me some tea. He
      always looks shocked when I drink four cups, so let me get through the
      first two before he arrives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't sit there if I were you," said Digby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a drip coming through the roof just there which will get you on
      the back of the neck every time you lean forward."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Willmot shifted the biscuit-tin. It was not easy to find a spot to
      put it The roof of the kitchen leaked badly in several places.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Miss Willmot," said Digby. "I wonder if you could do anything
      about this. I've just been round to the guard-room. There's a poor devil
      there&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Language! language!" said Miss Nelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was on her knees beside the stove rescuing her plate of toast from
      danger. Drops of water were falling on it from the knees of Digby's
      breeches every time he moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is," said Digby, speaking with great precision, "an unfortunate man
      at this moment incarcerated in the cell behind the guard-room, under the
      stern keeping of the Provost Sergeant I hope that way of saying it
      satisfies you, Miss Davis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For goodness' sake, don't talk Camp shop," said Miss Davis. "Let's have
      our tea in peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink, I suppose," said Miss Willmot "Why will they do it, just at
      Christmas, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This isn't a drunk," said Digby. "The wretched devil has been sent down
      here under arrest from No. 73 Hospital. He's to be court-martialled. He's
      only a boy, and a decent-looking boy, too. I hate to think of his being
      shut up in that cell all by himself at Christmas with nobody to do
      anything for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can we do?" said Miss Willmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't do anything, of course," said Digby, "but I thought you might."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see what I can do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, try," said Digby. "If you'd seen the poor fellow&mdash;&mdash; But
      you'll do something for him, won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Digby had a fine faith in Miss Willmot's power to do "something" under any
      circumstances. Experience strengthened his faith instead of shattering it.
      Had not Miss Willmot on one occasion faced and routed a medical board
      which tried to seize the men's recreation-room for its own purposes? And
      in the whole hierarchy of the Army there is no power more unassailable
      than that of a medical board. Had she not obtained leave for a man that he
      might go to see his dying mother, at a time when all leave was officially
      closed, pushing the application through office after office, till it
      reached, "noted and forwarded for your information, please," the remote
      General in Command of Lines of Communication? Had she not bent to her will
      two generals, several colonels, and once even a sergeant-major? A padre,
      fourth class, though he had once been curate of St. Ethelburga's, was a
      feeble person. But Miss Willmot! Miss Willmot got things done, levelled
      entanglements of barbed red tape, captured the trenches of official
      persons by virtue of a quiet persistence, and&mdash;there is no denying it&mdash;because
      the things she wanted done were generally good things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major opened the door of the kitchen. He stood for a moment on the
      threshold, the water dripping from his cap and running down his coat,
      great drops of it hanging from his white moustache. He was nearer sixty
      than fifty years of age. The beginning of the war found him settled very
      comfortably in a pleasant Worcestershire village. He had a house
      sufficiently large, a garden in which he grew wonderful vegetables, and a
      small circle of friends who liked a game of bridge in the evenings. From
      these surroundings he had been dug out and sent to command a base camp in
      France. He was a professional soldier, trained in the school of the old
      Army, but he had enough wisdom to realize that our new citizen soldiers
      require special treatment and enough human sympathy to be keenly
      interested in the welfare of the men. He grudged neither time nor trouble
      in any matter which concerned the good of the Camp. He had very early come
      to regard Miss Willmot as a valuable fellow-worker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Padre," he said, "I put it to you as a Christian man, is this an evening
      on which anyone ought to be asked to practise Christmas carols?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear, hear," said Miss Nelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've only had one practice, sir," said Digby, "and I've put up notices
      all over the Camp that the carols will be sung to-morrow evening. It's
      awfully good of you to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of me," said Miss Nelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're here, in any case," said Digby. "The men are tremendously pleased,
      sir," he added, "that you're going to sing. They appreciate it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They won't appreciate it nearly so much when they hear me," said the
      Major. "I haven't sung a part for, I suppose, twenty years."
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas carols have been sung, and we may suppose practised beforehand,
      in odd places, amid curious surroundings. But it is doubtful whether even
      the records of missionaries in heathen lands tell of a choir practice so
      unconventional as that held on Christmas Eve in the kitchen of Miss
      Willmot's canteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain beat a tattoo on the corrugated iron roof. It dripped into a
      dozen pools on the soaking floor, it fell in drops which hissed on to the
      top of the stove. There was no musical instrument of any kind. The
      tea-tray was cleared away and laid in a corner. The Major, white-haired,
      lean-faced, smiling, sat on the packing-case in the middle of the room.
      Miss Willmot sat on her biscuit-tin near the stove. Miss Nelly perched,
      with dangling feet, on a corner of the sink in which cups and dishes were
      washed Digby, choir-master and conductor, stood in front of the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then," he said, "we'll begin with 'Nowell.' Major, here's your note&mdash;La-a-a"&mdash;he
      boomed out a low note. "Got it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "La-a-a," growled the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Willmot, alto," said Digby, "la-a-a. That's right Miss Davis, a
      third higher, la-a-a. My tenor is F. Here's the chord. La, la, la, la.
      Now, one, two, three. 'The first Nowell the angels did say&mdash;&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain hammered on the roof. The Major plodded conscientiously at his
      bass. Miss Nelly sang a shrill treble. Digby gave the high tenor notes in
      shameless shouts. "Good King Wenceslas" followed, and "God rest you merry,
      gentlemen." Then the Major declared that he could sing no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you'd get another bass, padre," he said. "I'm not trying to back
      out, but I'm no good by myself. If I'd somebody to help me, a second bass&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nobody," said Digby. "I've scoured the whole camp looking for a
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If only Tommy were here," said Miss Nelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tommy has a splendid voice. And I don't see why he mightn't be here
      instead of stuck in that silly old hospital He's quite well. He told me so
      yesterday. A bullet through the calf of the leg is nothing. Major,
      couldn't you get them to send Tommy over to the Camp just for to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major shook his head. He had every sympathy with Miss Nelly. He knew
      all about Tommy. So did Miss Willmot. So did Digby. Miss Nelly made no
      secret of the fact that she was engaged to be married to Tommy Collins.
      She was proud of the fact that he was serving as a private in the Wessex
      Borderers, wishing to work his way up through the ranks to the commission
      that he might have had for the asking. No Wessex man ever entered the
      canteen without being asked if he knew Private 7432 Collins, of the 8th
      Battalion. Every one&mdash;even the sergeant-major&mdash;had to listen to
      scraps read out from Tommy's letters, written in trenches or in billets.
      When Tommy was reported wounded, Miss Willmot had a bad day of it with an
      almost hysterical Nelly Davis. When the wound turned out to be nothing
      worse than a hole in the calf of the leg, made by a machine-gun bullet,
      Miss Nelly cried from sheer relief. When, by the greatest good luck in the
      world, Private 7432 Collins was sent down to 73 General Hospital, no more
      than a mile distant from the Camp, Miss Nelly went wild with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't be done," said the Major. "If it were any other hospital&mdash;but
      the people in No. 73 don't like me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major was a stickler for extreme accuracy in the filling in of all
      official papers. The staff of No. 73 Hospital cured its patients of their
      wounds, but sometimes turned them loose afterwards, insufficiently,
      occasionally even wrongly, described and classified. The Major invariably
      called attention to these mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major, though particular on some points, was a kindly man. He did not
      want to speak evil of the hospital authorities. He was also a little tired
      of hearing about Tommy Collins. He changed the subject abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, Miss Willmot," he said, "it's all right about the men's
      Christmas dinner. I spent an hour this morning strafing everybody in the
      cook-house. I told them they must try to make the Yorkshire pudding.
      Heaven knows what it will be like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they'll only follow the receipt I gave them&mdash;&mdash;" said Miss
      Willmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>If</i>," said Digby. "But those cooks are rotters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow," said the Major, "there'll be a decent dinner. Roast beef, plum
      pudding, oranges, and then all the things you have for them in the
      canteen. They'll not do badly, not at all badly."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed his hands together and smiled with benevolent satisfaction. He
      had arranged to eat his own Christmas dinner at the unholy hour of three
      in the afternoon. He meant to see that all went well at the men's dinner,
      and that their tea was sufficient. He meant to look in for an hour at the
      canteen festivities. He had promised to sing Christmas carols. From three
      to four was the only time left at which he could dine. But that thought
      did not spoil his satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digby saw, or thought he saw, his opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's one poor fellow in the guard-room, sir," he said. "Will he get
      any Christmas dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He winked at Miss Willmot as he spoke. This was the time for her to back
      up his charitable appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the Major, "I'm afraid I can't do much for him. It's a serious
      charge, a case of a Field General Court Martial. I'm afraid there's no
      doubt about the facts. I'm sorry for him. He's quite young; but it's a
      disgraceful thing for any man to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major's face hardened. For many offences and most offenders he had
      some sympathy; but a man who sinned against the code of military honour
      had little pity to expect from the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Willmot looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it very bad?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of those cases of self-wounding," said the Major. "Shot himself in
      the leg with his own rifle."
    </p>
    <p>
      There are cases of this kind, a few of them. Some wretch, driven half
      frantic by terror, worn out with hardships, hopeless of any end of his
      sufferings, seeks this way out. He gains a week of rest and security in a
      hospital ward. Then he faces the stern judgment of a court martial, and
      pays the penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor fellow!" said Miss Willmot. "Poor boy! What he must have gone
      through before he did that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He went through no more than any other man went through," said the Major;
      "but they stuck it and he shirked. There are men enough who deserve our
      pity, Miss Willmot We can't afford to waste sympathy on cowards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Willmot was of another mind. For her there was a law higher even than
      the Major's lofty code of chivalry and honour. She had pity to spare for
      cowards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major himself was not wholly consistent As he rose to leave the
      kitchen he spoke of the prisoner again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He doesn't look like a man who'd do it. He looks like a gentleman. That
      makes it worse, of course, much worse. All the same, he doesn't look it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Digby, when the Major left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't do anything," said Miss Willmot "In a case of this kind there's
      nothing to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Willmot made up a little parcel before she left the canteen.
      There were cigarettes in it, and chocolate, and a couple of mince pies,
      and a large slice of cake, and some biscuits. Afterwards she acted
      lawlessly, offended against discipline, treated rules and regulations with
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant O'Rorke was sitting in the guard-room playing patience when Miss
      Willmot entered. He stood up at once and saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terrible weather, miss. I'll never say again that it rains in the County
      Galway. Sure, it doesn't know how. A man would have to come to France to
      find out what rain is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergeant," said Miss Willmot, "I want to speak to your prisoner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant O'Rorke scratched his ear doubtfully. Miss Willmot had no right
      to see the prisoner. He had no right to open the door of the cell for her.
      They had hammered some respect for discipline into Sergeant O'Rorke when
      he served in the Irish Guards. But they had not hammered the Irish nature
      altogether out of him. He was willing to go to great lengths, to take
      risks in order to oblige a friend whom he liked and respected. He had an
      Irishman's feeling that laws and regulations are not meant to apply to
      ladies like Miss Willmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you think to ask leave of the Major, miss?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Miss Willmot, "I didn't ask anybody's leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a pity now," said O'Rorke; "but sure the Major would never have
      said no if you'd have asked him."
    </p>
    <p>
      He fitted the key into the lock and flung open the door of the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prisoner, 'tention," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Willmot entered the small square room, lit by a single electric
      light. It was entirely bare of all furniture, save a single rug, which lay
      rolled up in a corner. The walls and floor were lined with sheets of zinc
      A young man stood stiffly to attention in the middle of the room. Miss
      Willmot stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned to Sergeant O'Rorke. "Shut the door please, sergeant, and
      wait outside."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man neither stirred nor spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tommy!" said Miss Willmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "7432! Private Collins, miss, 8th Wessex Borderers."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a tone of hard, cold fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tommy," said Miss Willmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awaiting trial by Field General Court Martial on a charge of deliberately
      wounding himself in the leg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tommy," said Miss Willmot again, "you didn't do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy broke down suddenly. The hardness and the anger vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Willmot," he said, "for God's sake don't tell Nelly that I'm here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't do it," said Miss Willmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I didn't do it," he said. "There's been some infernal blunder.
      I didn't know what the damned idiots meant when they put me under arrest I
      didn't know what the charge was till they marched me in to the C.O. here.
      He told me. Oh, the Army's a nice thing, I can tell you. I was expecting
      to get my stripe over that raid when I got hit with a bullet in my leg,
      and here I am charged with a coward's trick. I suppose they'll prove it I
      suppose they've got what they call evidence. I only hope they'll shoot me
      quick and have done with it I don't want to live."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Willmot went over to the boy and took his hand. She led him to the
      corner of the bare room. They sat down together on the folded blanket She
      talked to him quietly, sanely, kindly. For half an hour she sat there with
      him. Before she left, hope had come back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you worry about my being here," he said "If things are cleared up
      in the end I shan't mind a bit about spending a night or two in this cell.
      With all the things you've brought me"&mdash;the cake, chocolate, and
      cigarettes were spread out on the floor&mdash;"I'll have a merry
      Christmas, better than the trenches, anyhow. But, I say, don't tell Nelly.
      She might fret."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christmas festivities in the Camp were enormously successful. The men
      had cold ham for breakfast, a special treat paid for by the Major. They
      assembled for church parade, and Digby gave them the shortest sermon ever
      preached by a padre. The Major, who liked to play the piano at church
      service, was so startled by the abrupt conclusion of the discourse, that
      he started "O Come, All ye Faithful," in a key so low that no one could
      sing the second line. The Major pulled himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you were," he said, and started again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men, thoroughly roused by the novelty of the proceedings, yelled the
      hymn. The dinner was all that could be hoped. Sweating cooks staggered
      into the dining-hall with huge dishes of meat and steaming cauldrons of
      potatoes. Sergeants, on that day acting as servants to the men, bore off
      from the carving-tables plates piled high. The Yorkshire pudding looked
      like gingerbread, but the men ate it The plum pudding was heavy, solid,
      black.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major, smiling blandly, went from table to table. Miss Nelly, flushed
      with excitement and pleasure, laughed aloud. Only Miss Willmot looked on
      with grave eyes, somewhat sad. She was thinking of Tommy Collins in his
      cell, with the weight of an intolerable accusation hanging over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, not even Miss Willmot had time to be thoughtful. There was a
      pause in the festivities for an hour or two after dinner. The men smoked,
      slept, or kicked at a football with spasmodic fits of energy. Then the
      canteen was opened. Miss Willmot's great cake was cut The men passed in a
      long file in front of the counter. Miss Willmot handed each man a slice of
      cake. Other ladies gave crackers and mince pies. Digby, garrulous and
      friendly, distributed cigarettes. The Major stood at the far end of the
      room under the glistening white star. He was waiting for the moment to
      arrive at which he should make his speech, a speech sure to be received
      with genuine applause, for it was to be in praise of Miss Willmot The
      Major did that kind of thing well. He had the proper touch, could catch
      the note appropriate for votes of thanks. He knew his talent, and that
      Christmas Day he meant to do his best.
    </p>
    <p>
      An orderly entered the canteen, looked round it, caught sight of the
      Major. He pushed his way through a crowd of laughing men who munched cake,
      smoked furiously, and decked each others' heads with paper caps from
      crackers. He reached the Major at last, and handed him a note. The Major
      read it and swore. Then he began to push his way towards the counter. The
      orderly followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gangway," he called, "gangway, men. Make way for the Major."
    </p>
    <p>
      Way was made at last The Major seized Digby by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a damned nuisance," he said. "I beg pardon, padre, an infernal
      nuisance. I've got to go to the orderly room. Those fellows in No. 3
      Hospital are ringing me up. Why couldn't they keep quiet on Christmas Day?
      I must go though, and I may be kept. You'll have to make the speech and
      thank Miss Willmot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Digby escaped making the speech in the end. Just as the distribution of
      cakes and mince pies had finished, when Digby was searching frantically
      for an opening sentence, the Major returned. He made two speeches. One was
      in a low voice across the counter to Miss Willmot. The other was to the
      men. It was all about Miss Willmot. It was beautifully phrased. But she
      did not hear a word of it She was scarcely aware of the men's cheers,
      though the paper festoons swayed to and fro, and the Chinese lanterns
      shook with the violence of the shouting. For the Major had said this to
      her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right about that boy in the guard-room, the prisoner you know,
      who was to have been court-martialled. Some blatant idiot of an orderly
      sergeant mixed up two sets of papers, and put the wrong man under arrest.
      They're sending over the right man now. I told Sergeant O'Rorke to bring
      that poor boy straight here from the guard-room. Keep a bit of cake for
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while the men were cheering the Major's other speech that Tommy
      Collins, guided by Sergeant O'Rorke, entered the canteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nelly saw him at once. She stretched herself across the counter to
      grasp his hands, upsetting the few remaining mince pies, and scattering
      crackers right and left. If the counter had not been so broad and high she
      would in all probability have kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Tommy!" she said. "And I'd given up all hope of seeing you. This is
      just a perfect Christmas box. How did you get here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy Collins looked appealingly to Miss Willmot. His eyes begged her as
      plainly as if words had crossed his lips not to tell the story of his
      arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you are here," said Miss Nelly, "you must help us with the carols.
      The Major's a perfect darling, but he can't sing bass for nuts. You'll do
      it, won't you? I'm singing, and so is Miss Willmot."

    <h2>
      V ~~ HER RIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jocelyn was generally considered a clever woman. Her husband
      respected her intellect. He was, and still is, Professor of Psychology in
      one of our younger Universities, so he could give an expert's opinion on
      any question of mental capacity. Her sons said she was clever. There were
      two young Jocelyns, Ned, a barrister, and Tom, a junior master in a public
      school. Ned used to give me his opinion of his mother very often.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mater is extraordinarily clear-headed," he would say. "If you want to
      see your way through a muddle, just you talk it over with her. It's an
      awful pity she&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ned would shrug his shoulders. He was a loyal son, and he never said
      in plain words what the pity was. Tom spoke in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dad's all right," he used to say, "European reputation and all that; but
      the mater has the brains of our family. If only she wouldn't&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      I agreed with both of them. Mrs. Jocelyn was one of the cleverest women I
      ever met, but&mdash;well, on one subject she was an intolerable bore. That
      subject was Woman's Suffrage. She could not keep off it for very long, and
      once she started there was no stopping her. All her friends suffered. It
      cannot be said that she argued. She demanded, aggressively insisted on sex
      equality, on justice and right for women, right in every sphere of life,
      political right, social right, economic right, all kinds of other right.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, was in the old days before the war. Since August, 1914,
      most things have changed. Professor Jocelyn, indeed, still lectures on
      psychology, half-heartedly now, to a rapidly dwindling class of young
      women. But Ned Jocelyn's name is painted in black letters on a brown
      wooden cross at the head of a grave&mdash;one of a long row of graves&mdash;in
      a French cemetery. Tom is trying to learn to walk without crutches in the
      grounds of an English hospital. Mrs. Jocelyn is out in France, working in
      a canteen, working very hard. It is only occasionally now that she demands
      a "right;" but when she does, she demands it, so I understand, with all
      her old ferocious determination to get it This is the story of how she
      once demanded and took a "right."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly midday, and the camp lay under a blazing sun. It was early
      in July, when all England and all France were throbbing with hope, pride
      and terror as the news of the "Big Push" came in day by day. There was
      little calm, and few hearts at ease in those days, but Number 50
      Convalescent Camp looked peaceful enough. It is miles from the firing
      line. No shells ever burst over it or near it. Only occasionally can the
      distant rumble of the guns be heard. A spell of dry weather had cracked
      the clay of the paths which divided it into rectangles. The grass was
      burnt and brown. The flower beds, in spite of diligent watering, looked
      parched. The great white tents, marquees guyed up with many ropes, shone
      with a blinding glare. In the strips of shade made by the fly sheets of
      the tents, men lay in little groups. Their tunics were unbuttoned or cast
      aside. They smoked and chatted, speaking slowly and briefly. Oftener they
      slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only in one corner of the camp was there any sign of activity. Near the
      main entrance is the orderly room. Inside, a sweating adjutant toiled at a
      mass of papers on the desk before him. From time to time a sergeant
      entered the room, saluted, spoke sharply, received his orders, saluted and
      went out again. From the clerk's room next door came the sound of voices,
      the ceaseless clicking of a typewriter, and the frequent clamorous summons
      of a telephone bell. Outside, orderlies hurried, stepping quickly in one
      direction or another, to the Quarter-master's stores, to the kitchen, to
      the wash-houses, to twenty other points in the great camp to which orders
      must go, and from which messages must return. The bugler stood in the
      verandah outside the orderly room, ready to blow his calls or strike the
      hours with a hammer on a suspended length of railway line. At the entrance
      gate, standing sharply to attention as a guardsman should, even under a
      blazing sun, was Private Malley, of the Irish Guards, wounded long ago,
      now wearing the brassard of the Military Police. He saw to it that no
      person unauthorized entered the camp. Above him, limp from its staff, hung
      the Red Cross flag, unrecognizable that day, since there was no faintest
      breeze to stir its folds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close by the flag staff is the little dressing station. Here the men in
      the camp, men discharged from hospital, are seen by the doctors and the
      period of their rest and convalescence is decided. They are marked "Fit,"
      and go to the fighting again, or sent back and enjoy good quarters and
      pleasant food for a while longer. Or&mdash;best hope&mdash;marked
      "Blighty" and go home. This is the routine. But sometimes there is a
      difference. There had been a difference every day since the "Big Push"
      started. Outside the dressing station was a group of forty or fifty men.
      They lay on the ground, most of them sound asleep. They lay in the
      strangest attitudes, curled up, some of them; others with arms and legs
      flung wide, the attitudes of men utterly exhausted, whose overpowering
      need is rest. Some sat huddled up, too tired to sleep, blinking their eyes
      in the strong sunshine. Most of these men wore bandages. Bandages were on
      their heads, their hands, their arms and legs, where sleeves and trousers
      had been cut away. Some of them had lost their caps. One here and there
      had lost a boot. Many of them wore tattered tunics and trousers with long
      rents in them. All of them were covered with mud, mud that had dried into
      hard yellow cakes. These were men sent straight down from the field
      dressing stations, men who had been slightly wounded, so slightly that
      there was no need for them to go to hospital. Among them there was one man
      who neither lay huddled nor sprawled. He sat upright, his knees drawn up
      to his chest, held tight in his clasped hands. He stared straight in front
      of him with wide, unblinking eyes. Of all the men in the group, he was the
      muddiest His clothes were caked with mud. His face was covered with mud.
      His hair was matted with mud. Also his clothes were the raggedest of all.
      The left leg of his trousers was rent from knee to waistband. The skin of
      his thigh shone white, strangely white compared to his face and hands,
      through the jagged tear. The sleeves of his tunic were torn. There was a
      hole in the back of it, and one of his shoulder straps was torn off. He
      was no more than a boy, youthful-looking compared even to the men, almost
      all of them young, who lay around him. He had a narrow face with that look
      of alert impudence which is common on the faces of gutter snipes in large
      cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat staring he spoke now and then, spoke to himself, for there was
      no one to listen to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We beat them," he said once. "We gave them the damnedest beating. We
      strafed them proper, and they ran. The Prussian Guards they was."
    </p>
    <p>
      His accent betrayed him. He must have come from Lancashire, from some
      grimy Lancashire town, from Warrington or Bolton, from Liverpool itself
      perhaps, or Manchester. Before the war there were crowds of such boys
      there. They made up the football crowds on Saturday afternoons. They made
      the countryside hideous on bank holiday afternoons. They were the despair
      of church and chapel, of the social reformer, and often of the police.
      This boy was under-sized, of poor chest development, thin-limbed, weedy;
      but there was a curious light in those staring eyes of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the man on his right, a great, heavy-jawed Irishman with a
      bandaged knee, who was sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wake up, Pat," he says, "wake up till I tell you how we strafed Fritz.
      Out in the open it was, the Prussian Guards."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Irishman slept on. Neither shaking nor shouting roused a sign of
      intelligence in him. The boy turned to the man on his left, a Canadian, an
      older man with a gentle, worn face. Perhaps because he was older or more
      utterly wearied out, or in pain this man waked and raised himself on one
      elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We went for them proper," said the boy. "Prussians they was and Guards.
      They thought they'd walk over us; but by God we talked to them, talked to
      them with the bayonet, we did."
    </p>
    <p>
      A slow smile played across the Canadian's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, Tommy," he said, "what's your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wakeman, Private Wakeman, No. 79362. Gosh, Canada, but we handled them
      and they ran."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They certainly did run some," said the Canadian slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Wakeman poured out his story, a wonderful story, told in jerky
      sentences, garnished with blasphemies and obscene words. He had been a
      member of the Lewis Gun team. Very early in the advance the bursting of a
      high explosive shell had buried him, buried the whole gun team with its
      officer, buried the gun. Wakeman and three other men and the officer had
      crawled out from the mud and dbris. Somehow they had unearthed the gun.
      Driven on by a kind of frenzy, they had advanced again, halting, firing a
      drum of cartridges, advancing again. Once more a shell caught them and
      buried them. Once more Wakeman crawled out, clawed his way out with hooked
      fingers, bit the loose clay with his mouth, bored through it with his
      head, dug at it with his toes. This time he and the officer were alone.
      They struggled to recover their gun, working fiercely, till a bullet hit
      the officer. After that Wakeman went on by himself, managed somehow to get
      among the men of the company to which his gun team belonged, and possessed
      himself of a rifle. At that point his story became incoherent. But about
      one thing he was clear. He and the others of his company had met in
      straight hand to hand fighting the proudest troops of Germany. By
      stabbing, lunging, battering with clubbed rifles, they had put the
      Prussian Guard to flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," drawled the Canadian, "they did run. They certainly did run some.
      And what's the matter with you, sonny? Hit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buried," said Wakeman, "buried twice, and shrapnel in my leg, little
      bits."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bits were little, but there were a good many of them. Half an hour
      later Wakeman passed into the dressing station in his turn. The doctor
      looked him over, scribbled a word or two on the label which hung from the
      lad's breast pocket, and patted him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be all right, my boy," he said. "No shell shock. No D.A.H. Get
      along with you. Feeling a bit hungry, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," said Wakeman. "Yes, sir, feel as if I could do with a
      bit of something to eat The way of it was this, sir. We strafed them
      proper, we did. The Prussian Guards they was, and&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the doctor had no time to listen to the story. "Get along now. Get
      along. The sooner the dressing is done, the sooner you'll get your
      dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The story, which the doctor would not hear, bubbled out into the ears of
      the nursing sister who picked the scraps of shrapnel out of Wakeman's leg.
      They were tiny fragments, most of them, but there were a great many, and
      it took the nurse twenty minutes to get through her job. The story was
      told twice over in jerks and snatches, just as it had been told to the
      Canadian, only the obscene words were unuttered and the oaths, when they
      slipped out now and then, were followed by apologies. Every soldier, even
      a Lancashire gutter snipe, has in him this curious instinct. His talk is
      commonly full of blasphemies and obscenities, devoid of all sense or
      meaning, efforts at futile emphasis, apparently necessary and inevitable.
      But if there is a woman within earshot, no such words pass his lips. A
      girl might sit all day among these men, and, if they knew she was there,
      her ears would never be sullied with the sound of a foul word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Released at last from the dressing station, Wakeman and five or six others
      were taken to the bathhouse. The corporal who led the way, the bath
      orderly who provided soap and towels, and the wounded Irishman who was
      given the bath next to Wakeman's, all heard scraps of the story, learnt
      the essential fact that Wakeman and his pals had strafed the Prussian
      Guard. It was the Irishman who reduced the excited boy to silence for a
      few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want to be talking that way for?" he said. "Didn't we all
      give them hell? Didn't I bring back three prisoners myself. Three? It's
      five I would have had, only for a stray shell that bursted alongside of
      the communication trench and lifted two of them off me. Bad luck to that
      same shell, for a bit of it took me under the knee. But what matter? Only,
      mind this, what you did to the Prussian Guard wasn't in it with what that
      shell did to them two Boches. You'd have been sorry for the blighters, so
      you would, if so be you could have found a bit of either of them big
      enough to be sorry for."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wakeman had no reply to make to that. It is not possible with a bayonet,
      or even with a Lewis gun, to cause the total disappearance of an enemy's
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his bath, with a clean shirt on him and a clean pair of socks,
      Wakeman dined. There is no lack of good food in Number 50 Convalescent
      Camp, and men recovering from wounds often have healthy appetites. But
      Wakeman ate, gorged himself, to the astonishment even of the kitchen
      orderlies. Plateful after plateful of stewed meat and potatoes, steaming
      and savoury, disappeared. Yet there was no sign about the boy of the
      lassitude of repletion. His eyes remained bright and glanced rapidly here
      and there. His body was still alert, the movements of his hands quick and
      decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, rest Wakeman found himself with other new-comers in a tent
      in the corner of the camp. The Irishman was there, still lamenting in
      picturesque phrases the loss of his two prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the biggest of them&mdash;a fine figure of a man he was&mdash;had the
      beautifullest helmet on him that ever was seen; worth twenty francs it
      was, any day, and me without a penny in my pocket But where was it after
      the shell bursted? Tell me that if you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Canadian was there, patiently ready to listen to any story, having
      apparently no story of his own to tell. Wakeman began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the Prussian Guard," he said, "and we gave them proper hell, we
      did, out in the open. No blasted machine guns. Just them and us with the
      bayonet And&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked in vain. In the tent were beds, real beds with mattresses of
      woven wire, and palliasses stuffed with straw. Stretched flat on his back
      the Irishman snored. His head pillowed on his folded arm the Canadian
      slept peacefully, a quiet smile, like a child's, on his face. Wakeman
      looked at them and snorted with contempt For him no sleep was possible. He
      pulled a bench to the door of the tent, and sat in the sunshine. He found
      the lid of a cigarette tin and set to work to scrape the mud off his
      clothes and boots. But the work wearied him. With a piece of string he
      laced up the long rent in his trousers, cutting holes in the material with
      the blade of a knife. Then, still obstinately disinclined for sleep, he
      went out to explore the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one end of the camp is a hut, a long, low building. It is one of those
      canteens and recreation huts, which, working through various
      organizations, the public at home provides for the men in France. They are
      familiar enough to everyone in France, and the men know that there is a
      welcome for them however often they pass the doors. In this hut Mrs.
      Jocelyn works all day long and every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she cooks, making vast puddings, stewing cauldrons full of
      prunes or figs. Sometimes she stands behind the counter serving bowls of
      tea, coffee, cocoa, lemonade, to thirsty men. Sometimes, half asphyxiated
      with tobacco smoke, she sits at the piano and hammers out rag-time tunes,
      while the men crowd round her, their faces close to her as they peer at
      the music, their voices threatening her with deafness when they bellow in
      her ears. Sometimes she sits for an hour beside some dull-eyed victim of
      shell shock, patiently trying to coax or trick him back to some interest
      in life again, giving him, literally, her own vitality, until, "virtue
      gone out" of her, she must seek fresh strength for herself in the less
      exhausting toil of a scullery maid. Thus she pays to man the debt she owes
      to God for the cross over the grave of one son dead, and the unconquerable
      spirit of the other crippled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a slack hour when Private Wakeman, in his grotesquely tattered
      clothes, limped through the door. Only a few men were in the hut, writing
      or playing draughts. A boy at the piano was laboriously beating out a
      discordant version of "Tennessee." Mrs. Jocelyn sat on a packing-case, a
      block of paper on her knee, writing a letter to a man who had left the
      camp to go up the line again. Another woman, a fellow worker, was
      arranging plates of cakes and biscuits on the counter, piling bowls ready
      to hand for the crowd of men who would come later, clamouring for tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Private Wakeman stood in the middle of the hut and looked around him. He
      sought companionship, longed to find some one to whom he could tell his
      story and make his boast about the Prussian Guard. His eyes wandered from
      one to another of the men who were writing or playing games. He found
      little encouragement. It seemed impossible to join himself to any one of
      them. He looked at the lady busy with the bowls and plates. His eyes
      rested at last on a great dish of stewed figs which stood on the counter.
      He had eaten an incredible quantity of food in the dining-hall two hours
      before, soup, beef, potatoes, cabbage, pudding, cheese. But he had not
      eaten stewed figs. His whole boy's nature rose in him in one fierce
      longing for stewed figs. He remembered. Before he went into the attack he
      had possessed half a franc and two sous. He thrust his hand into his one
      trouser pocket. It was empty. He tore at the string with which he had
      laced up the slit in his trousers. On that side there was not a pocket
      left. It and all it ever contained, were gone. He fumbled in the pockets
      of his tunic, found three mangled cigarettes, the stump of a pencil, a
      letter from his mother, and, at last, two English penny stamps, survivals
      of days which seemed years ago, when he had been in camp in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were fixed on the stewed figs. The longing in him grew fiercer,
      intolerable. He approached the counter slowly. He laid on it the two
      stamps, dirty almost beyond recognition. He smoothed them out carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady," he said, "I haven't got no money but&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The worker laid down her bowls, looked at the two stamps, and then at the
      boy. She was a woman of experience and discernment She saw the muddy,
      tattered clothes. She read the look of desire in the eyes. She understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stewed fruit, lady, and&mdash;and custard."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned from the boy to Mrs. Jocelyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's clean against all rules," she said. "I know I oughtn't to, but I
      must&mdash;-I simply must give this boy something."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jocelyn looked up from her writing. She saw all that the other had
      seen. She had talked with many men. One glance was enough for her. She
      knew what the boy had been through. With swift intuition she guessed at
      what he felt and how he yearned. She saw the name of his regiment on his
      one remaining shoulder strap. It was her dead boy's regiment, and every
      man in it was dear to her. Already the other lady was at work, putting a
      spoonful of stewed figs on a soup plate. Mrs. Jocelyn seized her by the arm
      and dragged her roughly back from the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't dare to do it," she said, "it's my right No one else has so good a
      right to do it as I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Private Wakeman sat down to a plate piled with stewed figs, swamped
      with a yellowish liquid called custard in canteens in France. Beside him
      were jam tarts and great slabs of cake. From a mouth never empty, though
      he swallowed fast, came in short gushes the story of the strafing of the
      Prussian Guard, told at last to ears which drank in greedily every word of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Jocelyn claimed and took at last her dearest right.

    <h2>
      VI ~~ JOURNEY'S END
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had a long journey before me, and I looked forward to it with dread. It
      is my habit when forced to travel in France, the part of France chiefly
      affected by the war, to resign myself to a period of misery. I relapse
      into a condition of sulky torpor. Railway Transport Offices may amuse
      themselves by putting me into wrong trains. Officers in command of trains
      may detach the carriage in which I am and leave it for hours in a siding.
      My luggage may be&mdash;and generally is&mdash;hopelessly lost. I may
      arrive at my destination faint for want of food. But I bear all these
      things without protest or complaint. This is not because I am particularly
      virtuous or self-trained to turn the other cheek to the smiter. I am
      morally feeble, deficient in power of self-defence, a lover of peace with
      discomfort, rather than honourable strife.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt no small joy when I discovered that Thompson was to be my
      travelling companion on this particular journey. I had travelled with
      Thompson before. I knew that he always secured food, that he never lost
      his luggage, that he had an instinct for recognizing the right train when
      he saw it, and that he had a healthy disregard for the dignity of the
      official persons who clog the feet of wayfarers in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      We met at the station. Thompson's breezy good humour gave me fresh
      confidence at once. He looked energetic, hopeful and charged with
      vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along." he said, "we'll report to the R.T.O. at once and get it
      over."
    </p>
    <p>
      In France under existing conditions the traveller reports to the Railway
      Transport Officer when he starts his journey, when he finishes it and at
      all intervening opportunities. An R.T.O. must lead a harassed and
      distressful life. He sees to it that the traveller has a fair share of
      life's trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      This particular R.T.O. began by trying to get us into a wrong train. I
      suppose that was the line of least resistance for him. It was easier to
      put us into the first train that came along. We should have been off his
      hands, and another R.T.O stationed somewhere else, would have had the job
      of getting us switched back on to our proper track again. The first man&mdash;and
      this was all he cared for&mdash;would have been rid of us. Thompson was
      equal to the situation. He talked vigorously to that R.T.O.. Thompson
      holds no very exalted rank in the army. I often wonder he is not tried by
      Court Martial for the things he says. But the R.T.O., so far from
      resenting Thompson's remarks, offered us a sort of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been on duty ten hours," he said, "and there's a whole battery of
      artillery lost somewhere along the line. It never was my fault; but every
      general in the whole army has been ringing me up about it. The telephone
      bell hasn't stopped all day. Damn! There it is again."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was; loud, angry and horribly persistent. Even Thompson felt sorry for
      the R.T.O.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind," he said, "you'll get your Military Cross all right in the
      end. All you fellows do. Now buck up a bit and find our train for us. It's
      X. we want to get to."
    </p>
    <p>
      I mention this incident to show the kind of man Thompson is and his way of
      dealing with difficulties. Under his care I felt that I should travel
      safely and get to X. in the end. Comfort was not to be expected, but
      Thompson did all that could be done to mitigate our misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made our start from a platform blocked with piles of officers' luggage
      and crowded with confused and anxious men. Subalterns in charge of drafts
      asked other subalterns what they ought to do and received counter
      inquiries by way of reply. Sergeants stormed blasphemously at men who had
      disappeared in search of tea. Staff officers, red tabbed and glorious,
      tried to preserve an appearance of dignity while their own servants
      staggering under the weight of kit bags, bumped into them. Hilarious men,
      going home on leave, shouted sudden snatches of song. A decrepit
      Frenchman, patient in the performance of duty, blew feeble blasts on a
      small horn. Thompson, alert and competent, found a compartment. He put me
      in and then he bundled in my valise. After that he found his own luggage,
      an enormous kit bag, two sacks, a camp bedstead, a hammock chair and a
      number of small parcels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get them in somehow," he said. "We'll settle down afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson did the settling afterwards. He so arranged our belongings that
      we each had a seat The door by which anyone else might have to get in at
      another station was hopelessly blocked. The small parcels were put on the
      rack above our heads. Thompson gave me a list of their contents as he put
      them in their places. They contained bread, butter, meat, biscuits,
      cheese, a bottle of wine and a flask of brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're here till two o'clock to-morrow morning&mdash;till two o'clock at
      best We must have something to eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      A selfish traveller&mdash;I am profoundly selfish&mdash;would have been
      content to keep that compartment secure from intrusion. We had completely
      barricaded the door and no one could have got in if we had chosen to
      defend our position. But Thompson was not selfish. The train stopped at a
      station every quarter of an hour or so, and Thompson climbing up the
      barricade, opened the window and took a look out every time we stopped. At
      one station&mdash;it was then about 7 p.m. and quite dark&mdash;he
      discovered a forlorn boy&mdash;a second-lieutenant&mdash;who was trying to
      find room for himself and his belongings. Thompson hailed him. The next
      five minutes were passed in fierce toil by all of us. But before the train
      started Thompson got the boy and his belongings into our compartment. In
      my opinion no second-lieutenants ought to be allowed to possess a
      suit-case as well as a valise. This boy also had three top-coats and a
      Jaeger rug. We spent nearly half an hour settling down again after that.
      Then we dined, sharing the food&mdash;Thompson's food&mdash;with the
      second-lieutenant. He was a nice boy and very grateful. I thought him a
      little garrulous, but Thompson encouraged him to talk. He told us all
      about his job. It was his duty to go up in captive balloons and send down
      messages to the artillery. It was, by his account, a sea-sicky business,
      worse by several degrees than crossing the Channel in the leave boat.
      Thompson, who has a thirst for every kind of information, questioned and
      cross-questioned the boy. After dinner&mdash;dinner was Thompson's name
      for our meal&mdash;I prepared to go to sleep. Thompson arranged valises on
      the floor in such a way that I could stretch my legs. The boy went on
      talking. He told Thompson that he had dropped out of the ballooning
      business and that he was going to X. to submit to a special course of
      training. I forget what it was, bombing probably, or the use of trench
      mortars, possibly map reading or&mdash;a subject part of the school
      curriculum of our grandmothers&mdash;the use of globes. The army has a
      passion for imparting knowledge of any kind to temporary lieutenants. I
      went to sleep while Thompson was explaining just where the boy's
      particular course of instruction was given, a camp some three or four
      miles out of X. Thompson has an amazing knowledge of what naturalists
      would call the habitat of the various parts of the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 3 a.m. I was awakened from my sleep. We had reached, an hour late, the
      junction at which we had to change. Thompson and the boy were both alert
      and cheerful. They had, I fancy, been talking all the time. Our junction
      proved to be a desolate, windswept platform, without a sign of shelter of
      any kind except a bleak-looking cabin, the habitation of the local R.T.O.
      Thompson roused him ruthlessly and learned that, with luck, we might
      expect our next train to start at six. I shivered. Three hours, the very
      coldest in the twenty-four, on that platform, did not strike me as a
      pleasant prospect Thompson used a favourite phrase of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," he said, "it's war; what the French call <i>La Guerre</i>."
      He professed to have discovered, not from the R.T.O. but from a sleepy
      French railway official, that the train, our train in which we were to
      travel, was somewhere in the neighbourhood, waiting for its engine. It did
      not come to us from anywhere else; but made its start, so to speak took
      its rise, at that junction. Thompson and our new friend, the boy, proposed
      to get into the train when they found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson can speak French of a sort, but he does not understand the
      language as spoken by the French people. I did not believe that he had
      really found out about that train. I declined to join in the search. He
      and the boy went off together. They came back in about half an hour. They
      said they had found a train standing by itself in a field and that it must
      be ours because there was no other. The reasoning did not seen conclusive
      to me, but I agreed to go and sleep in whatever train they had found. I
      suggested that we should leave our luggage on the platform and pick it up
      when the train got there at 6 a.m.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," said Thompson, "is just the way luggage gets lost. Suppose&mdash;I
      don't say it's likely or even possible&mdash;but suppose the train we get
      into goes somewhere else. Nice fools we'd look, turning up in Paris or
      Marseilles without a brush or comb among us. No. Where I go I take my
      luggage with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson was evidently not so sure about that train as he pretended to be.
      But I had reached a pitch of hopeless misery which left me indifferent
      about the future. It did not seem to me to matter much just then whether I
      ever got to X. or not. We had to make three trips, stumbling over railway
      lines and sleepers, in the dark, falling into wet ditches and slipping on
      muddy banks; but in the end we got all our luggage, including the boy's
      top-coats, into a train which lay lifeless and deserted in a siding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Thompson and the boy slept. I sat up stiff with cold. At
      half-past five a French railway porter opened our door and invited us to
      descend, alleging that he wanted to clean the carriage. I was quite
      pleased to wake Thompson who was snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up," I said, "there's a man here who wants to clean the carriage and
      we've got to get out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm damned if I get out," said Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman repeated his request most politely. If the gentlemen would
      be good enough to descend he would at once clean the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson fumbled in his pocket and got out an electric torch. At first I
      thought he meant to make sure that the carriage required cleaning.
      Thinking things over I came to the conclusion that he felt he could talk
      French better if he could see a little. He turned his ray of light on the
      Frenchman and said slowly and distinctly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nous sommes officiers anglais, et les officiers anglais ne descendent pas&mdash;jamais."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman blinked uncertainly. Thompson added:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jamais de ma vie."
    </p>
    <p>
      That settled the French porter. He was face to face with one of the
      national idiosyncrasies of the English, a new one to him and
      incomprehensible, but he submitted at once to the inevitable. He gave up
      all idea of cleaning the carriage and Thompson went to sleep again. The
      boy slept soundly through the whole business.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past seven&mdash;the train had been jogging along since six&mdash;Thompson
      woke and said he thought he'd better shave. The proposal struck me as
      absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can't possibly shave," I said, "without water."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson was quite equal to that difficulty. The next time the train
      stopped&mdash;it stopped every ten minutes or so&mdash;he hopped out with
      a folding drinking cup in his hand. He returned with the cup full of hot
      water. He had got it from the engine driver. He and I shaved. The boy
      still slept, but, as Thompson pointed out, that did not matter. He was too
      young to require much shaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice boy that," said Thompson. "Son of an archdeacon; was at Cambridge
      when the war broke out. Carries a photo of his mother about with him. Only
      nice boys carry photos of their mothers. He has it in a little
      khaki-coloured case along with one of the girl he's going to marry&mdash;quite
      a pretty girl with tously hair and large eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he's engaged to be married, is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course he is. That sort of boy is sure to be. Just look at him."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he lay there asleep his face looked extraordinarily young and innocent.
      I admitted that he was just the sort of boy who would get engaged to the
      first girl who took him seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girl's out here nursing," said Thompson. "V.A.D. Evidently has a strong
      sense of duty or she wouldn't be doing it V.A.D.-ing isn't precisely a
      cushy job. He's tremendously in love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems to have confided most of his affairs in you," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Told me," said Thompson, "that the girl has just been home on leave. He
      hoped to get back, too, to meet her, thinks he would have got a week if he
      hadn't been ordered off on this course, bombing or whatever it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson washed while he talked. It could scarcely be called a real wash,
      but he soaped his face, most of his neck and his ears with his shaving
      brush and then dipped his handkerchief in the drinking cup and wiped the
      soap off. He was certainly cleaner afterwards; but I felt that what was
      left of the water would not clean me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on Thompson secured some rolls of bread, two jam pastries and six
      apples. The bread and pastry I think he bought The apples I am nearly sure
      he looted. I saw a large basket of apples in one of the waggons of a train
      which was standing in the station at which Thompson got out to buy our
      breakfast They were exactly like the apples he brought back.
    </p>
    <p>
      We woke up the boy then. It did not matter whether he shaved or not; but
      at his age it is a serious thing to miss a chance of food.
    </p>
    <p>
      About midday we arrived at a large town. Thompson learned from the R.T.O.
      who inhabited the railway station there that we could not get a train to
      take us any further till ten o'clock that night. He said again that was
      war, what the French call <i>guerre</i>, but he seemed quite pleased at
      the prospect of the wait He spoke of looking for a proper meal and a
      Turkish bath. The bath we did not succeed in getting; but we had an
      excellent luncheon: omelette, fried fish, some kind of stewed meat and a
      bottle of red wine. The boy stuck to us and told us a lot more about his
      girl. His great hope, he said, was that he would meet her somewhere in
      France. I could see that what he really looked forward to was a wound of a
      moderately painful kind which would necessitate a long residence, as a
      patient, in her hospital. He was, as Thompson said, a nice boy; but he
      talked too much about the girl. He was also a well-educated boy and
      anxious to make the best of any opportunities which came his way. He told
      us that there was an interesting cathedral in the town and proposed that
      we should all go and see it after lunch. Thompson is not an irreligious
      man. Nor am I. We both go to church regularly, though not to excess, but
      we do not either of us care for spending week day afternoons in a
      cathedral. Thompson still hankered after a Turkish bath. I had a plan for
      getting a bedroom somewhere and going to sleep. We sent the boy off to the
      cathedral by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turkish bath, as I said, was unobtainable We walked through most of
      the streets of that town looking for it. Then Thompson proposed that we
      should have afternoon tea. That we got in a small room above a pastry
      cook's shop. The girl who served us brought us tea and a large assortment
      of sticky pastry. Thompson hates sticky pastry. There is only one kind of
      cake made in France which he will eat. I knew what it was, for I had often
      had tea with Thompson before. I should have recognized one if I had seen
      it; but I could not remember the French name for it Thompson insisted on
      describing its appearance to the girl. He gave his description in English
      and the girl looked puzzled. I tried to translate what he said into French
      and she looked still more puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then from the far corner of the room came a pleasant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think <i>brioche</i> is the word you want." It was. I recollected it
      directly I heard it. I turned to thank our interpreter. She was a young
      woman in the uniform of a V.A.D. She was sitting at a table by herself,
      was, in fact, the only other occupant of the room. I thanked her. Thompson
      joined in and thanked her effusively. There was not much light in the room
      and her corner was decidedly gloomy. Still, it was possible to see that
      she was a decidedly pretty girl. We both said that if there was anything
      we could do for her we should be very pleased to do it After the way she
      helped us out with the <i>brioche</i> we could scarcely say less.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," she said, "you may be able to tell me when I will be able to
      get a train to&mdash;&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She mentioned one of those towns of which the English have taken temporary
      possession, turning the hotels into hospitals, to the great profit of the
      original proprietors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Thompson. "There's a train at 9 p.m. But you'll be
      travelling all night in that. If I were you I'd stay here till to-morrow
      morning and then&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't," said the girl. "Properly speaking I'm due back to-day; but I
      missed the early train this morning and only got here an hour ago. The
      boat was horribly late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Thompson, "you're coming back after leave, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl sighed faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." she said, "but I've had a fortnight's leave; I can't complain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll just write down that train for you," said Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scribbled 9 p.m. on a piece of paper and carried it over to the girl.
      It seemed to me an unnecessary thing to do. Nine is a simple number, easy
      to remember. Some thought of the same kind occurred to the girl. She
      looked at Thompson, first with some surprise, and then, I thought, rather
      coldly. She was evidently not inclined to accept any further friendly
      offers from Thompson. He did not seem in the least abashed even when she
      turned her shoulder to us and looked the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen the cathedral here?" said Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really think," said Thompson, "that you ought to pay a visit to the
      cathedral. You'll like it, you really will. And you've got hours before
      you. I don't see how you can fill in the time if you don't go to the
      cathedral."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said the girl without turning round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not going there," said Thompson, "or I'd offer to show you the way.
      But you can't miss it. You can see the spire from the window. It's the
      finest specimen of early Gothic in the north of France. The glass is
      superb. There's an altar piece by Raphael or Botticelli, I forget which.
      The screen is late Italian Renaissance, and there's a tomb in the west
      transept which is supposed to be that of the Venerable Bede."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl got up and walked out of the room. I was not surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thompson," I said, "what do you mean by behaving like a cad? Any one
      could see that she is a nice girl; a lady, not that sort at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as for that rigmarole of yours about the cathedral&mdash;what the
      devil do you know about Italian Renaissance, or Botticelli or early
      Gothic? I never heard such rot in my life. As a matter of fact I've always
      heard that the glass in this cathedral is poor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same," said Thompson, "if she goes there she'll be pleased.
      She'll find something she'll like a great deal better than stained glass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for the Venerable Bede," I said, "he was buried in Oxford if he was
      buried anywhere, and I don't know that he was. He might have been
      cremated, or minced up by high explosives so that they couldn't bury him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I recognized her," said Thompson, "I went over to her table and
      had a good look to make sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't pretend you know her," I said "She certainly didn't know you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I looked at her photograph five times at least last night while you were
      asleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought this over for a minute. Then I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to tell me that she's the girl that boy is engaged to be
      married to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The exact same girl," said Thompson. "I couldn't be mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      I meditated on the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope," I said, "that he won't have left the cathedral before she gets
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No fear," said Thompson, "he's a most conscientious boy. Having started
      out to do that cathedral he'll look at every stone of it before he leaves.
      He'll be there for hours yet. What I'm afraid of is that she won't go
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She started in the right direction," I said "I saw her out of the
      window."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did my best anyhow," said Thompson. "I told her I wasn't going there.
      She didn't like me. I could see that. If I'd let her think I was going to
      the cathedral she'd have marched straight off to the station and sat in
      the Ladies' Waiting-room till her train started."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, it appeared, did visit the cathedral and the boy was there. He
      was waiting for us on the platform at the railway station at half-past
      nine. He talked half the night to Thompson about his wonderful stroke of
      luck. Just as I dropped off to sleep I heard Thompson quoting Shakespeare.
      It was, to the best of my belief, the only time in his life that Thompson
      ever did quote Shakespeare.

      VII~~ HIS GIRL
    </h2>
    <p>
      There were thirty or forty officers in the lounge of the hotel, all
      condemned, as I was, to spend the greater part of the day there. Some men
      have better luck. It was the fourth time I had been held up in this
      wretched place on my way back to France after leave. Dragged out of our
      beds at an unreasonable hour, crammed into a train at Victoria, rushed
      down to an embarkation port as if the fate of the empire depended on our
      getting there without a minute's delay, we find, when we get out of the
      train, that the steamer will not start for three hours, four hours, on
      this occasion six hours. We are compelled to sit about in an hotel,
      desolate and disgusted, when we might have been comfortable in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked round to see if there were anyone I wanted to talk to. There were&mdash;I
      had seen them at Victoria&mdash;three or four men whom I knew slightly,
      but I had no particular wish to spend hours with any one of them. I had
      just decided to go out for a walk by myself when I felt a slap on my
      shoulder. I turned and saw Daintree. I was uncommonly glad to see him.
      Daintree and I were friends before the war and I have always found him an
      amusing companion. He greeted me heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great luck," he said, "running into you like this. I don't see a single
      other man I know in the whole crowd. And any way I particularly wanted to
      talk to you. I've got a story to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      We secured a corner and two comfortable chairs. I lit a pipe and waited.
      Daintree is a wonderful man for picking up stories. The most unusual
      things happen to him and he gets mixed up in far more adventures than
      anyone else I know. And he likes telling stories. Usually, the men who
      have stories to tell will not talk, and the men who like talking have
      nothing interesting to tell. Daintree is exceptional.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it this time?" I asked. "What journalists call a 'sob story,' or
      is it meant to be humorous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should call it a kind of joke," said Daintree; "but my wife says it's
      the most pathetic thing she's ever heard. It makes her cry even to think
      of it You can take it either way. I'll be interested to see how you do
      take it. I was thinking of writing it to you, 'for your information and
      necessary action, please.' My wife wanted me to, but it's too long for a
      letter. Besides, I don't see what you or anyone else could possibly do in
      the matter. You may give advice&mdash;that's what my wife expects of you&mdash;but
      there's really no advice to give. However, you can tell me how it strikes
      you. That's what I want to know, whether you agree with my wife or with
      me. You know Simcox, don't you, or do you? I forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simcox?" I said. "Is that a tall, cadaverous man in the Wessex? Rather
      mournful looking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the man. Came home from a remote corner of the Argentine, or
      somewhere like that, early in the war, and got a commission. He's a
      captain now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I met him," I said, "down Albert way, shortly before the push last year.
      I can't say I knew him. He seemed to me rather a difficult kind of man to
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So my wife says," said Daintree. "He's older than most of us, for one
      thing, and has spent twenty years all by himself herding sheep or branding
      bullocks, or whatever it is they do out in those places. Naturally he'd
      rather lost touch with life at home and found it difficult to fit himself
      in; especially with a lot of boys straight from the 'Varsities or school.
      They were mostly boys in his battalion. Anyhow, he seems to have been a
      bit morose, but he did his job all right in the regiment and was
      recommended for the M.C.. He got knocked out in the Somme push and jolly
      nearly lost a leg. They saved it in the end and sent him down to my place
      to convalesce."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daintree owns a very nice place in the Midlands. In the old days it was
      one of the pleasantest houses I know to stay in. Daintree himself was a
      capital host and his wife is a charming woman. The house is a convalescent
      home for officers now, and Mrs. Daintree, with the help of three nurses,
      runs it. Daintree pretends to regard this as a grievance, and says it was
      all his wife's doing, though he was just as keen on the place as she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damned nuisance," he said, "finding the place full of boys rioting when I
      get home on leave. And it's full up now&mdash;twelve of them, no less.
      There's hardly a spot in the house I can call my own, and they've spoiled
      the little lake I made at the bottom of the lawn. That young ass Pat
      Singleton started what he called boat-races on it&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Pat Singleton's there?" I said. "I knew; he'd been wounded, but I
      didn't hear he'd been sent to your place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pat Singleton's always everywhere," said Daintree. "I've never come
      across a place where he wasn't, and he's a devil for mischief. Remind me
      afterwards to tell you about the trick he played on the principal nurse, a
      Scotchwoman with a perfectly terrific sense of her own dignity," Daintree
      chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'd rather tell me that story," I said, "instead of the one about
      Simcox, I'd just as soon have it. In fact, I'd prefer it. Sob stories are
      always trying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'm not sure that the Simcox one is a sob story, though there's a
      certain amount of slosh in it. Anyhow, I've got to tell it to you, for my
      wife says you're the only man she knows who can advise what ought to be
      done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," I said, "but Pat Singleton's escapades always amuse me. I'd
      like to hear about his making an apple-pie bed for that nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daintree chuckled again, and I gathered from the expression of his face
      that the nurse had endured something worse than an apple-pie bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or about the boat-races," I said. "I didn't know you had anything which
      floated on that lake of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't," said Daintree, "except the kind of wooden box in which the
      gardener goes out to clear away the duck-weed. However, Pat Singleton
      comes into the Simcox story in the end. It's really about him that my wife
      wants your advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one," I said, "can give advice about Pat Singleton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knowing the sort of man Simcox is," said Daintree, "you'll understand
      that he was rather out of it at first in a-house full of boys just out of
      hospital and jolly glad to have a chance of running about a bit. Pat
      Singleton wasn't there when Simcox arrived. But the others were nearly as
      bad; silly jokes from morning to night and an infernal row always going
      on. My wife likes that sort of thing, fortunately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simcox, I suppose, just sat by himself in a corner of the veranda and
      glowered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. And at first my wife could do nothing with him. In the end, of
      course&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the end," I said, "she persuaded him to tell her his inmost secrets
      and to confide to her the tragedy of his soul. That's just what she would
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Daintree is a very kind and sympathetic lady. When she talks to me I
      feel ready to tell her anything. A man like Simcox, shy, reserved, and
      wholly unaccustomed to charming ladies, would succumb to her easily and
      pour out a love story or anything else he happened to have on his chest at
      the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," said Daintree, "his leg was pretty stiff and he couldn't get
      about much, even if he'd wanted to. There was nothing for him to do except
      sit in a deck-chair. My wife felt it her duty to talk to him a good deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daintree seemed to be making excuses for Mrs. Daintree and Simcox. They
      were unnecessary. Mrs. Daintree would have got his story out of him if she
      thought he was really in need of sympathy, whether he sat in a chair all
      day or was able to row races in the lake in the gardener's punt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow," said Daintree, "what he told her&mdash;he told it to me
      afterwards, so there's no secret about it&mdash;was this: He got hit in
      the leg during an advance through one of those woods north of the Somme,
      Mametz, I think. It was a beastly place. Our fellows had been in there two
      days before and had to clear out again. Then Simcox's lot went in&mdash;you
      know the sort of thing it was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shell holes, and splintered tree trunks," I said. "Machine-guns
      enfilading you, and H.E. bursting promiscuous. I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Sirmcox' fellows went in all right, and stayed there for a while.
      Simcox says he remembers noticing that the ground was strewed with dbris
      left by the Germans when they cleared out, and by our fellows afterwards.
      Equipment, rifles and all the rest of it lying about, as well as other
      things&mdash;pretty ghastly things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't go into details," I said. "I can guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm only telling you this," said Daintree, "because all the stuff lying
      about seems to have interested Simcox. It's odd the feelings men have at
      these times. Simcox says the thing he chiefly wanted to do was to tidy up.
      He had a kind of strong desire to pick things up and put them away
      somewhere. Of course he couldn't; but he did pick up one thing, a
      cigarette case. He showed it to me. It was one of those long-shaped, flat
      white metal cases which fellows carry because they hold about thirty
      cigarettes. Simcox says he doesn't know why he picked it up. He didn't
      want it in the least. He just saw it lying there on the ground and stuffed
      it into his pocket Almost immediately after that he was hit. Bit of
      shrapnel under the knee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember hearing about that business," I said. "We were driven out
      again, weren't we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. And Simcox was left behind. He couldn't walk, of course. But he
      crawled into a shell hole, and there he lay. Well, for the next two days
      that wood wasn't healthy for either side. The Germans couldn't get back,
      because we were sprinkling the whole place with shrapnel. We couldn't
      advance for similar reasons. Simcox just lay in his shell hole. He tied up
      his leg somehow. He had some brandy in a flask as well as his iron
      rations. But he hadn't much tobacco. There were only two cigarettes in his
      own case. However, he had the other case, the one he picked up. There were
      nearly twenty in it Also there was&mdash;I say, at this point the story
      gets sloppy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind," I said. "Go on. What else was in the cigarette case? A
      farewell letter to a loving wife? Love to little Willie and a text of
      Scripture?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so bad as that. A photo of a girl. He showed it to me when he told me
      the story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good looking girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very. Large eyes&mdash;sort of tender, you know, and appealing; and a
      gentle, innocent face, and a mouth&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose," I said, "that these raptures are necessary if I'm to
      understand the story. Otherwise, you may skip them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't possibly skip them," said Daintree. "The whole point of the story
      depends on your realizing the sort of girl she was. Pathetic&mdash;that's
      the word I want. Looked at you out of the photo as if she was a poor,
      lonely, but uncommonly fetching little thing, who wanted a strong, true
      man to shelter her from the evil world. She was got up in some sort of
      fancy dress which kind of heightened the effect. I don't altogether
      profess to understand what happened, though my wife says she does. But
      Simcox in a sort of way fell in love with her. That's not the way he put
      it He didn't feel that she was just an ordinary girl&mdash;the sort one
      falls in love with. She was&mdash;well, he didn't think of her as flesh
      and blood&mdash;more a kind of vision&mdash;spiritual, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angel?" I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sort of thing. You know. That was the idea that gripped Simcox while
      he lay there in the shell hole. Stars came out at night and Simcox felt
      that she was looking down at him. In the day he used to lie and gaze at
      her. When he thought it was all up with him and that he couldn't live, he
      seemed to hear her voice&mdash;I say, you ought to hear my wife telling
      this part of the story. Simcox wouldn't tell it to me, naturally; but he
      seems to have enlarged on it a good deal to her. He says that only for
      that photo he'd have given in and just died. I daresay he wouldn't really,
      but he thinks he would. Anyhow, he didn't He stuck it out and his leg
      didn't hurt nearly as much as he expected. He attributes that to the
      influence of this&mdash;this&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angel visitant?" I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can call her an angel if you like," said Daintree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," I said, "seems to me a pure sob story. If there's any other part
      less harrowing, I wish you'd hurry up and get to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Daintree. "I'll cut out the rest of his experiences in
      that shell hole, though, mind you, they're rather interesting and
      frightfully poetic the way my wife tells them. After two days our fellows
      got back into the wood and kept it. The stretcher-bearers found Simcox in
      his hole and they lugged him down to a Casualty Clearing Station. From
      that he went to a hospital&mdash;the usual round, He had a pretty bad
      time, first over there, and then, when they could move him, in London. By
      degrees he got more sane about the photo. He stopped thinking she was any
      kind of spirit and took to regarding her just as a girl, though a very
      exceptional kind of girl, of course. He was hopelessly in love with her.
      Do you think a man really could fall in love with a photo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simcox did," I said, "so we needn't discuss that point."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The chances were, of course," said Daintree, "that she was some other
      fellow's girl, possibly some other fellow's wife. But Simcox didn't care.
      He was too far gone to care for anything except to get that girl. Those
      morose, shy men are frightfully hard hit in that sort of way, I'm told.
      That's what my wife says, anyhow. They get it much worse than we do when
      they do get it. Simcox would have dragged that girl out of the arms of an
      archbishop if that was where he found her. Of course he couldn't go
      hunting her over England while he was in hospital with a bad leg; but he
      made up his mind to find out who she was and where she lived as soon as he
      was well enough to go about He'd very little to go on&mdash;practically
      nothing. The photo had been cut down so as to fit into the cigarette case,
      so that there wasn't even a photographer's name on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might have advertised," I said. "There are papers which go in for that
      sort of thing, publish rows of reproductions of photographs 'Found on the
      battle-field,'with requests for identification."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wife thought of that," said Daintree, "but Simcox didn't seem to take
      to the idea. He said the photo was too sacred a thing to be reproduced in
      a paper. My own idea is that he was afraid of any kind of publicity. You
      see, the other fellow might turn up&mdash;the fellow who really had a
      right to the girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How the deuce did he propose to find her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. He told my wife some rotten yarn about instinct guiding him
      to her; said he felt sure that the strength of his great love would
      somehow lead him to her side. He didn't say that to me, couldn't, you
      know. But it's wonderful what a fellow will say to a woman, if she's
      sympathetic, and my wife is. Still, even so, he must be more or less mad
      to think a thing like that. Mad about the girl. He's sane enough in every
      other way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can't be so mad as that," I said. "Just fancy going out into a field&mdash;I
      suppose that's the way you'd do it&mdash;and hanging about until your
      great love set you strolling off either to the right or to the left. No
      man, however mad, could expect to come on a girl that way&mdash;no one
      particular girl, I mean. Of course you'd meet several girls whichever way
      you went. Couldn't help it. The world's full of girls."

    <p>
      "I don't know what he meant," said Daintree, "but my wife sympathized with
      him and seemed to think he'd pull it off in the end. At first he was a bit
      shy of letting her see the photo; but when he saw she was as sympathetic
      as all that he showed it to her. Well, the moment she saw it, she felt
      that she knew the face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was a stroke of luck for Simcox."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No it wasn't," said Daintree, "for my wife couldn't put a name to the
      girl. She was sure she had seen her somewhere, knew her quite well, in
      fact, but simply couldn't fix her. Funny thing, but it was exactly the
      same when they showed me the photo. At the first glance I said right away
      that I knew her. Then I found I couldn't say exactly who she was. The more
      I looked the more certain I was that I'd seen her somewhere, her or
      someone very like her. And it wasn't a commonplace face by any means. Poor
      Simcox kept begging us to think. My wife went over our visitors' book&mdash;we've
      kept one of those silly things for years&mdash;but there wasn't a name in
      it which we couldn't account for. I got out all the old albums of
      snapshots and amateur photos in the house. You know the way those things
      accumulate; groups of all sorts. But we couldn't find the girl. And yet
      both my wife and I were sure we'd met her. Then one morning Simcox burst
      into my wife's little sitting-room&mdash;a place none of the convalescents
      have any right to go. He was in a fierce state of excitement. Said that an
      officer who'd arrived the night before was exactly like the photo and that
      the girl must be his sister or cousin, or something. The only officer who
      came that night was&mdash;you'd never guess!&mdash;Pat Singleton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pat," I said, "though a young devil, is cheerful, and I never saw him
      anything but self-confident I can't imagine a girl such as you described
      bearing the faintest resemblance to that boy. You said that she was a kind
      of die-away, pathetic, appealing angel. Now Pat&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," said Daintree. "All the same, the likeness was there. The moment
      I looked at the photo with Pat in my mind I knew why I thought I
      recognized it My wife said the same thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Pat Singleton hasn't any sisters," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he hasn't He hasn't even a first cousin anything like the age of the
      girl in the photo. I knew all the Singletons well, have for years. But
      Simcox insisted his girl must be some relation of Pat's, and in the end I
      promised to ask the boy. In the first place, if she was a relation, it
      seemed an impudent sort of thing to do, and if she wasn't, Pat would be
      sure to make up some infernal story about me and a girl and tell it all
      over the place. However, my wife egged me on and poor Simcox was so
      frightfully keen that I promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I sent for Pat Singleton next morning. He was a little subdued at
      first, as much subdued as I've ever seen him. He thought I was going to
      rag him about the spoof he'd played off on the nurse. He did that before
      he was twelve hours in the house. Remind me to tell you about it
      afterwards. I don't wonder he looked piano. She'd been going for him
      herself and that woman is a real terror. However, he cheered up the moment
      I showed him the photo of the girl. He asked me first of all where the
      devil I'd got it. Said he'd lost it somewhere before he was wounded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it was his, then?" I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Daintree, grinning, "it was his. He was particularly anxious
      to know how I came by it. I didn't tell him, of course. Couldn't give
      Simcox away, you know. Then Pat began to cheek me. Asked if I'd fallen in
      love with the girl and what my wife would say when he told her. Said he
      carried the photo about with him and showed it to fellows just to watch
      them falling in love with her. It seems that nine men out of ten admired
      her greatly. He asked me if I didn't think she was the prettiest girl I'd
      ever seen, and that I wasn't the first man by any means who wanted her
      name and address. He grinned in a most offensive way and said that he
      never gave away that girl's name to anyone; that I ought to know better
      than to go running after a nice, innocent little thing like that who
      wouldn't know how to take care of herself. I wasn't going to stand much of
      that sort of talk from Pat Singleton. I told him straight that if he
      didn't tell me that girl's name and where she lived I'd make things hot
      for him. I threatened to report the little game he'd had with the nurse
      and that if I did he'd be court-martialled. I don't know whether a man
      could be court-martialled for cheeking a nurse, but the threat had a good
      effect on Pat He really was a bit afraid of that woman. I don't wonder,
      though it's the first time I've ever known him afraid of anyone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daintree paused and chuckled horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," I said, "who was the girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you tumbled to it yet?" said Daintree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Do I know her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say you exactly know her," said Daintree. "You know <i>him</i>.
      It was a photo of Pat himself dressed up as the Sleeping Beauty, or
      Fatima, or some such person in a pantomime they did down at the base last
      Christmas when he was there. The young devil carried the thing about with
      him so as to play off his silly spoof on every fellow he met I must say he
      made a damned pretty girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord!" I said. "And how did Simcox take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simcox hasn't been told&mdash;yet," said Daintree. "That's just what my
      wife wants your advice about You see it's an awkward situation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we tell him," said Daintree, "he'll probably try to kill Pat
      Singleton, and that would lead to a lot of trouble. On the other hand, if
      we don't tell him he'll spend the rest of his life roaming about the world
      looking for a girl who doesn't exist, and never did. It seems a pity to
      let that happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My idea," I said, "would be to get another girl, not necessarily like the
      photo, but the same type, appealing and pathetic and all that. He'd
      probably take to her after a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suggested that," said Daintree, "but my wife simply won't hear of it.
      She says the story as it stands is a great romance and that it would be
      utterly spoiled if Simcox switched off after another girl. I can't see
      that, can you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a case like this," I said, "when the original girl wasn't a girl at
      all&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly," said Daintree, "but when I say that my wife brings up the Angel
      in the Shell Hole part of the story and says that a great romance is its
      own reward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what to advise," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think you would," said Daintree, "though my wife insisted that
      you'd be able to suggest something. But you can tell me what you think of
      the story. That's what I really want to get out of you. Is it a Sob Story
      or just a rather unusual spoof?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," I said, "depends entirely whether you look at it from Simcox'
      point of view or Pat Singleton's."

    <h2>
      VIII ~~ SIR GALAHAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      The order, long expected and eagerly desired, came at last. The battalion
      moved out from dusty and crowded barracks to a camp in the wilderness.
      Lieutenant Dalton, a cheerful boy who had been taught Holy Scripture in
      his childhood, wrote to his mother that the new camp was "Somewhere in the
      wilderness beyond Jordan between the river of Egypt and the great sea."
      This description of the situation was so entirely inaccurate that the
      Censor allowed it to pass without complaint. Old Mrs. Dalton told her
      friends that her son was living under the shadow of Mount Sinai. He was,
      in fact, nowhere near either Jordan or Sinai. He was some miles east of
      the Suez Canal. For a week or so officers and men rejoiced in their new
      quarters. There was plenty of elbow room; no more of the overcrowding they
      had suffered since they landed. They had, indeed, miles of totally
      unoccupied desert at their disposal. Each tent might have stood in its own
      private grounds, three acres or so in extent, if that had not been felt by
      the colonel to be an inconvenient arrangement. There was also&mdash;and
      this particularly pleased the battalion&mdash;the prospect of a fight with
      the Turks. Everyone believed when the move was made that a battle was
      imminent, and the battalion, which had no experience of fighting, was most
      anxious to show what it could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      After awhile the enthusiasm for the new camp began to fade. The Turks did
      not put in an appearance, and life was as peaceful as it had been in the
      English camp where the battalion was trained. The situation of the camp,
      though roomy, was not exciting. Both officers and men began to find
      existence exceedingly dull. Lieutenant Dalton, who at this time wrote long
      letters to his mother, told her that he understood at last why the
      Children of Israel were so desperately anxious to get back to Egypt and
      were inclined to rag Moses about the want of melons and cucumbers. At the
      end of the month the whole battalion was bored to exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desert which stretched in front of the camp was intolerably flat The
      sun rose with pitiless regularity, shone with a steady glare for a great
      many hours, and then set. That was all that ever happened. The coming of a
      cloud into the sky would have been greeted with cheers. No cloud appeared
      A sandstorm, however disagreeable, would have been welcomed as a change.
      The sand stayed quietly where it was. The men tried football, and gave it
      up because of the blistering heat. They played "House" until even the
      excitement of that mild gamble exhausted itself. No other form of
      amusement suggested itself. There was not even any work to do. Had the
      battalion belonged to the Brigade of Guards it would no doubt have gone on
      doing barrack-square drill every day and all day long until the men
      learned to move like parts of a machine. But this was a Territorial
      battalion, and the colonel held reasonable views about modern warfare. The
      value of drill, a mechanical business, was in his opinion easily
      exaggerated. Had the battalion belonged to an Irish regiment there would
      probably have been several interesting fights and some means of obtaining
      whisky would have been devised. In such ways the men would have escaped
      the curse of monotony, and the officers would have been kept busy in the
      orderly room. But this battalion came from the English Midlands. The men
      did not want to fight each other, and had no overpowering desire to get
      drunk. When the morning parades were over they lay in their tents and
      grumbled peacefully. Under such circumstances tempers often wear thin, and
      a habit of bickering takes possession of a mess. It is greatly to the
      credit of everyone concerned that there was no sign of bad temper among
      the officers of the battalion. The colonel lived a good deal by himself in
      his tent, but was always quietly good-humoured. Lieutenant Dalton, an
      incurably merry boy, kept the other subalterns cheerful. Only Captain
      Maitland was inclined to complain a little, and he had a special
      grievance, an excuse which justified a certain amount of grumbling. He
      slept badly at night, and liked to read a book of some sort after he went
      to bed. The mess had originally possessed an excellent supply of books,
      some hundred volumes of the most varied kind supplied by the Camps
      Libraries' Association at home. Unfortunately, almost all the books were
      left behind when the move was made. Only three volumes were to be found in
      the new camp&mdash;one novel, a treatise on the culture of apple trees,
      and Mallory's "Morte D'Arthur."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Maitland blamed the chaplain for the loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to have looked after those books, padre," he said. "It's a
      padre's business to look after books."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. John Haddingly, C.F., was a gentle little man, liked by the
      officers because he was entirely unassuming, and popular with the men
      because he was always ready to help them. He accepted the whole blame for
      the loss of the books without an attempt to defend himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm awfully sorry, Maitland," he said. "I ought to have seen to those
      books. I did look after the Prayer Books. They're here all right; at least
      most of them are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prayer Books!" said Maitland. "If they were even whole Prayer Books! But
      those little yellow tracts of yours! They haven't even got the Thirty-Nine
      Articles in them. If they were pukka Prayer Books I'd borrow one and try
      to read it. I expect there are lots of interesting things in the small
      print parts of the Prayer Book, the parts you padres never read out. But
      what's the good of the books you have? Nothing in them but what we all
      know off by heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haddingly sighed. He was painfully conscious of the shortcomings of the
      Field Service Books supplied for the use of the troops. Dalton came to his
      defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't strafe the padre," he said. "He brought along a church, an entire
      church. Is there another padre in the whole Army who could have got a
      church to a place like this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dalton's almost incredible statement was literally true. Haddingly had
      succeeded, contrary to all regulations, in bringing with him from England
      a corrugated iron church. It was quite a small one, it folded up and could
      be packed flat When unpacked and erected it was undeniably a church. It
      had a large cross at one end of it outside. Inside it was furnished with
      an altar, complete with cross and candlesticks, a collapsible harmonium
      and a number of benches. Chaplains have certainly no right to load up
      troopships with churches, but Haddingly had somehow got his to Egypt. By
      what blandishments the transport officer had been induced to drag the
      thing out into the desert beyond the canal no one knew. Haddingly was one
      of those uncomplainingly meek men who never stand up for themselves. It is
      a curious fact, but it is a fact, that a really helpless person gets
      things done for him which the most aggressive and masterful men cannot
      accomplish. The success in life of women of the "clinging" kind is an
      illustration of this law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haddingly smiled with joy at the mention of his church. It stood, securely
      bolted together, a little outside the camp. No one, the cross being
      disproportionately large, could possibly mistake it for anything but a
      church. In front of it was a notice board, a nice black notice board with
      a suggestion of Gothic architecture about it. On the board, in bright
      white letters, was a list of services and the name of the church&mdash;St
      John in the Wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally, before the move into the desert, it had been simply St John
      the Evangelist, but Haddingly felt that the new circumstances demanded a
      change of dedication. Everyone, from the colonel down to the humblest
      private, was secretly proud of the church. The possession of such a thing
      gave a certain distinction to the battalion. Haddingly was a good deal
      chaffed about it; but the building was in a fair way to become a
      regimental mascot "I'm not strafing the padre," said Captain Maitland,
      "but I wish we had a few of the books we left behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To listen to you talking," said Dalton, "anyone would think you were some
      kind of literary swell&mdash;Hall Came and Wordsworth rolled into one,
      whereas we all know that the only thing you take an interest in is
      horses." Captain Maitland was very far from being a literary swell or
      claiming any such title. The books he really liked, the only books he read
      when he had a free choice, were sporting stories with a strong racing and
      betting interest But in camp in the wilderness no sporting stories were
      obtainable. The one novel which remained to the mess dealt with the sex
      problem, a subject originally profoundly uninteresting to Maitland, who
      had a healthy mind He read it, however, as a remedy for insomnia. It
      proved effective. A couple of chapters sent him to sleep every night, so
      the book lasted a good while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every morning at breakfast Maitland used to propound the problems raised
      by the chapters which he had read the night before. The mess got into the
      way of holding informal debates on the divorce laws. When he finished the
      book, Maitland declared that he intended to devote himself to Eugenics and
      the more enlightened kind of social reform as soon as the war was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never thought of it before," he said, "but I can see now that the
      future of the Empire really depends on the proper legislation for child
      welfare, on ante-natal clinic, and the abolition of the old empiric
      methods of marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till after I'm married before you begin," said Dalton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haddingly was a little pained. He said things about the sanctity of
      marriage and the family as a divine institution. No one else took Maitland
      seriously. It was felt that when the war came to an end&mdash;if it ever
      did&mdash;he would go back to horse-racing and leave the scientific
      aspects of marriage in decent obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished the novel he took the book on apple trees to bed with
      him. He became, after a short time, interested in that subject. He
      announced that when the war was over he intended to buy a small place in
      Devonshire and go in for orchards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apple growing," he said, "is just exactly the peaceable, shady kind of
      life a man wants after being stuck down in a desert like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With your taste for the turf," said Dalton, "you'll get into a shady kind
      of life all right, whether you plant apple trees or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dalton was an irreverent boy. Haddingly was greatly pleased at the thought
      of Maitland sitting innocently under an apple tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turn of Mallory came next Maitland left it for the last because the
      print was very small and the only light in his tent was a feeble candle.
      When he got fairly started in the book he became profoundly interested,
      and the other members of the mess were treated at breakfast time to a good
      deal of information about medieval warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As far as I can make out," Maitland said, "every officer in those days
      was knighted as soon as he got his commission."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jolly good idea," said Dalton. "I should buck about like anything if they
      made me a K.C.B."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't have been an officer or a knight," said Maitland. "You'd
      have been the court fool. You've no idea whatever of chivalry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most simple men who read very little, Maitland took the books he did
      read seriously and was greatly influenced by them. The apple tree treatise
      made him want to be a gardener. A slow and careful study of Mallory filled
      him with a profound admiration for medieval romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The reason modern war is such a sordid business," he said, "is that we've
      lost the idea of chivalry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chivalry is all very well," said Dalton, "if there's anyone to chival
      about. I haven't read much about those old knights of yours, Maitland; but
      so far as I can make out from what you tell us they were always coming
      across damsels, fair, distressed, and otherwise fetching. Now, I haven't
      seen a damsel since I left England. How the deuce can I be chivalrous? I
      defy anyone, even that Lancelot blighter of yours, to go into raptures
      about the old hag you turned out of the camp yesterday for selling rotten
      dates to the men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dalton was not the only member of the mess who made jokes about the
      knights of King Arthur's fellowship. But Maitland went on reading out
      selected passages from Mallory, and there is no doubt that everyone, even
      Dalton, became interested. Haddingly, the padre, made no attempt to
      conceal the fact that he was profoundly influenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had always been proud of his church, but had hitherto been content to
      use it in the normal way for parade services on Sunday morning. The
      services were undeniably popular. The men enjoyed singing hymns, and they
      listened patiently to the sermons because they liked Haddingly. The
      officers, who also liked Haddingly, attended the Sunday morning services
      with great regularity. Dalton, though he preferred playing rag-time on the
      piano, accompanied the hymns on the harmonium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haddingly was greatly moved by Maitland's account of the medieval spirit.
      He took to spending half an hour in the church every morning before
      breakfast Nobody knew what he did there. The officers, through feelings of
      delicacy, never asked him questions about these new devotions. The men,
      who were getting to know and like Haddingly better and better as time went
      on, regarded his daily visits to the church as proof that their padre was
      one who knew his job and did it thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning&mdash;the mess had then been discussing medieval chivalry for
      about a fortnight&mdash;Maitland read out a passage from Mallory about a
      visit paid by Sir Galahad to a lonely chapel among the mountains, "where
      he found nobody at all for all was desolate." Haddingly had just spent his
      lonely half hour in the church of St John in the Wilderness. He sighed. He
      found nobody there in the mornings, and could not help wishing that the
      battalion contained a Galahad. Dalton felt that something must be done to
      preserve the credit of the mess and the dignity of English manhood. He
      felt sure that sentiment about desolate chapels was an unwholesome thing.
      He scoffed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All very well for Gallipot," he said, "but&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Galahad," said Maitland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Galahad, or Gallipot, or Golly-wog," said Dalton. "If a man has a silly
      name like that, it doesn't matter how you spell it. The point is that it
      would be simply ridiculous to attempt that sort of thing now. Suppose, for
      instance&mdash;&mdash; I put it to you, padre. Suppose you saw Maitland
      mounted on one of the transport gee-gees trotting tap to that tin
      cathedral of yours&mdash;on a week-day, mind! I'm not talking about
      Sundays. Suppose he got down and went inside all by himself, what would
      you think, padre? There's only one thing you could think, that Maitland
      had been drinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Galahad," said Maitland, "went in to say his prayers. He was on his
      way to a battle. They didn't have to wait months and months for a battle
      in those days. They had a scrap of some sort about once a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. The Turks had failed to do what was expected of them, and life
      in the camp was intolerably dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Haddingly. It was plainly a padre's duty to support a
      spiritual and romantic view of life against the profane jibes of Dalton.
      Haddingly spoke judicially.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The general tone of society in those days," he said, "seems to have been
      very different from what it is now. Men had much less difficulty in giving
      expression to their emotions. No doubt we still feel much as they did, but&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Haddingly became aware that no one was listening to him. The attention of
      everyone at the table was attracted by something else. The men sat
      stiffly, listening intently. Haddingly heard a faint, distant humming
      sound. It grew louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jiminy!" said Dalton, "an aeroplane!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast table was laid in the open air outside the mess tent The men
      rose from their seats and stared in the direction of the coming sound. It
      was the first time that an aeroplane had approached the camp in the
      desert. Its coming was an intensely exciting event, an unmistakable
      evidence of activity somewhere; surely a sign that activity everywhere
      might be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound increased in volume. The machine appeared, a distant speck in
      the clear sky. It grew rapidly larger, flying fast. It was seen to be a
      biplane. It passed directly over the camp, flying so low that the head of
      the pilot was plainly visible. In a few minutes it passed from sight. The
      hum of its engines grew fainter. But till the sound became inaudible no
      one spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a babble of inquiry and speculation broke out Where was the thing
      going? What was it doing? What did its sudden swift voyage mean? For the
      rest of the day the camp was less sleepy than usual. Men everywhere
      discussed the aeroplane. Dalton was not the only one who envied the
      members of the Flying Corps. It seemed a very desirable thing to be able
      to rush through the air over unknown deserts; to have the chance of seeing
      strange and thrilling things, Arab encampments, green oases, mirages,
      caravans and camels; to drop bombs perhaps on Syrian fortresses; to
      estimate the numbers of Turkish columns on the march, to reckon their
      strength in artillery; to take desperate risks; to swerve and dart amid
      clouds of bursting shrapnel. How much more gloriously exciting such a life
      than that of men baking slowly in the monotony of a desert camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland, stimulated by his reading to an unnatural effort of imagination,
      recognized in the men of the Flying Corps the true successors of Mallory's
      adventurous knight-errants. For them war still contained romance. Chivalry
      was still possible. Haddingly caught the thought and expanded it Knights
      of old had this wonderful spirit, because to them the forests through
      which they roamed were unknown wastes, where all strange things might be
      expected. Then when all the land became familiar, mapped, intersected with
      roads, covered thick with towns, sailors inherited the spirit of romance.
      Afterwards all the seas were charted, policed, and ships went to and fro
      on ocean highways. The romance of adventure was lost to seamen, lost to
      the world, until the airmen came and found it again by venturing on new
      ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the aeroplane returned. Once more its engines were heard.
      Once more it appeared, a speck, a shape, a recognizable thing. But this
      time it did not pass away. On reaching camp it circled twice, and then,
      with a long swift glide, took the ground outside the camp a few yards
      beyond Haddingly's church of St. John in the Wilderness. The pilot stepped
      out of the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good man," said Dalton. "Friendly of him dropping in on us like this.
      Must want a drink after that fly. Eight hours at least. I'll go and bring
      him along to the mess. Hope he'll tell us what he's been doing. Wonder if
      the Turks potted at him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilot left his machine. He walked stiffly, like a man with cramped
      limbs, towards the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something wrong with the engine, perhaps," said Dalton. "Or he's short of
      petrol. I'll fetch him along. A whisky and soda in a big tumbler is the
      thing for him. I dare say he'll stay for dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      He started and walked quickly towards the machine. The airman, approaching
      the camp, reached the church. Instead of passing it he stopped, opened the
      door, and went in. Dalton paused and looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must have mistaken your tin cathedral for the mess, padre," he said.
      "I'll run on and fetch him out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he's made a mistake," said Haddingly, "he'll find it out for himself
      and come out without your fetching him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dalton stood still. His eyes were on the door of the church. Maitland and
      Haddingly were gazing at it too. The other officers, gathered in a group
      outside the mess tent, stood in silence, staring at the church. It seemed
      as if hours passed. In fact, nearly half an hour went by before the door
      of the church opened and the airman came out. He turned his back on the
      camp and went towards his machine. Neither Dalton nor anyone else made an
      attempt to overtake him. The noise of the engine was heard again. The
      machine raced a few yards along the ground and then rose in steep flight.
      It passed across the camp and sped westwards, its shape sharply outlined
      for a minute against the light of the setting sun. Then it disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland took Haddingly by the arm and led him to his tent The two men sat
      down together on the camp bedstead. Maitland opened Mallory's "Morte
      d'Arthur," and read aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Sir Galahad came unto a mountain, where he found an old chapel, and
      found there nobody, for all was desolate, and there he kneeled before the
      altar and besought of God wholesome counsel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it was just that," said Haddingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dalton put his head into the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I'd find you here," he said. "I just wanted to ask the padre
      something. Was that Sir Golliwog come to life again or just some ordinary
      blighter like me suffering from nerve strain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Haddingly had no answer to give for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can't have really wanted to sit in that church for half an hour," said
      Dalton. "What the dickens would he do it<i> for?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might have wanted to pray," said Haddingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even his profession justified the saying of such a thing as that
      outside church. But every excuse must be made for him. He had been soaked
      in Mallory for a fortnight Deserts, even when there are camps in them, are
      queer places, liable to upset men's minds, and the conduct of the airman
      was certainly peculiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, if you put it that way," said Dalton, "I've nothing more to
      say. All the same, he might have come into the mess for a drink. I'm not
      complaining of his doing anything he liked in the way of going to church;
      but I don't see that a whisky and soda would have hurt him afterwards. He
      must have wanted it."

      IX ~~ A GUN-RUNNING EPISODE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sam McAlister walked into my office yesterday and laid down a handful of
      silver on my desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are," he said, "and I am very much obliged to you for the
      loan."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment I could not recollect having lent Sam any money; though I
      should be glad to do so at any time if I thought he wanted it. Sam is a
      boy I like. He is an undergraduate of Trinity College, Dublin, and has the
      makings of a man in him, though he is not good at passing examinations and
      has never figured in an honours list. Some day, when he takes his degree,
      he is to come into my office and be made into a lawyer. His father, the
      Dean, is an old friend of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the money lying before me, and then doubtfully at Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you've forgotten all about it," he said, "it's rather a pity I paid.
      But I always was honest. That's one of my misfortunes. If I wasn't&mdash;&mdash;
      That's the fine you paid for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I remembered. Sam got into trouble with the police a few weeks ago.
      He and a dozen or so of his fellow-students broke loose and ran riot
      through the streets of Dublin. All high-spirited boys do this sort of
      thing occasionally, whether they are junior army officers, lawyers'
      clerks, or university undergraduates. Trinity College boys, being Irish
      and having a large city at their gates, riot more picturesquely than
      anyone else. Sam had captured the flag which the Lord Mayor flies outside
      his house, had pushed a horse upstairs into the office of a respectable
      stockbroker, and had driven a motor-car, borrowed from an unwilling owner,
      down a narrow and congested street at twenty-five or thirty miles an hour.
      He was captured in the end by eight policemen, and was very nearly sent to
      gaol with hard labour. I got him off by paying a fine of one pound,
      together with 2 4s. 6d. for the damage done by the horse to the
      stockbroker's staircase and office furniture. The motorcar, fortunately,
      had neither injured itself nor anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope," I said, pocketing the money, "that this will be a lesson to you,
      Sam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't," he said. "At least, not in the way you mean. It'll encourage
      me to go into another rag the very first time I get the chance. As a
      matter of fact, being arrested was the luckiest thing ever happened to me,
      though I didn't think so at the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," I said, "if you like paying up these large sums it's your own
      affair. I should have thought you could have got better value for your
      money by spending it on something you wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money isn't everything in the world," said Sam. "There is such a thing as
      having a good time, a rattling good time, even if you don't make money out
      of it and run a chance of being arrested. I daresay you'd like to hear
      what I've been at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you've committed any kind of crime," I said, "I'd rather you didn't
      tell me. It might be awkward for me afterwards when you are tried."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think it's exactly a crime," said Sam, "anyhow, it isn't anything
      wrong, though, of course, it may be slightly illegal. I'd rather like to
      have your opinion about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it a long story? I'm rather busy to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very long," said Sam, "but I daresay it would sound better after
      dinner. What would you say now to asking me to dine to-night at your club?
      We could go up to that library place afterwards. There's never anybody
      there, and I could tell you the whole thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam knows the ways of my club nearly as well as I do myself. There is
      never anyone in the library in the evening. I gave the required
      invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dined comfortably, and I got a good cigar for Sam afterwards. When the
      waiter had left the room he plunged into his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember the day I was hauled up before that old ass of a magistrate.
      He jawed a lot and then fined me 3 4s. 6d., which you paid. Jolly decent
      of you. I hadn't a shilling in the world, being absolutely stony broke at
      the time; so if you hadn't paid&mdash;and lots of fellows wouldn't&mdash;I
      should have had to go to gaol."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind about that," I said. "You've paid me back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, I'm grateful, especially as I should have missed the spree of my
      life if I'd been locked up. As it was, thanks to you, I walked out of the
      court without a stain on my character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, hardly that. You were found guilty of riotous behaviour, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, I walked out," said Sam, "and that's the main point."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, of course, the point which mattered most; and, after all, the
      stain on Sam's character was not indelible. Lots of young fellows behave
      riotously and turn out excellent men afterwards. I was an undergraduate
      myself once, and there is a story about Sam's father, now a dean, which is
      still told occasionally. When he was an undergraduate a cow was found tied
      up in the big examination hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam's father, who was very far from being a dean then, had borrowed the
      cow from a milkman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were a lot of men waiting outside," said Sam. "They wanted to stand
      me a lunch in honour of my escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your fellow-rioters, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, most of them had been in the rag, and, of course, they were sorry
      for me, being the only one actually caught. However, the lunch never came
      off. There was a queer old fellow standing on the steps of the court who
      got me by the arm as I came out. Said he wanted to speak to me on
      important business, and would I lunch with him. I didn't know what he
      could possibly have to say to me, for I had never seen him before; but he
      looked&mdash;it's rather hard to describe how he looked. He wasn't exactly
      what you'd call a gentleman, in the way of clothes, I mean; but he struck
      me as being a sportsman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horsey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the least. More like one's idea of some kind of modern pirate, though
      not exactly. He talked like an American. I went with him, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," I said, "anyone with an adventurous spirit would prefer
      lunching with an unknown American buccaneer to sharing a commonplace feast
      with a mob of boys. Did you happen to hear his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said it was Hazlewood, but&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it may not have been?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the other fellows called him Cassidy later on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," I said, "there were other fellows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were afterwards," said Sam, "not at first. He and I lunched alone.
      He did me well. A bottle of champagne for the two of us and offered me a
      second bottle. I refused that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He came to business after the champagne, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He more or less talked business the whole time, though at first I didn't
      know quite what he was at. He gassed a lot about my having knocked down
      those two policemen. You remember that I knocked down two, don't you? I
      would have got a third only that they collared me from behind. Well,
      Hazlewood, or Cassidy, or whatever his name was, had seen the scrap, and
      seemed to think no end of a lot of me for the fight I put up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The magistrate took a serious view of it, too," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There wasn't much in it," said Sam modestly. "As I told Hazlewood, any
      fool can knock down a policeman. They're so darned fat. He asked me if I
      liked fighting policemen. I said I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam caught some note of sarcasm in my voice. He felt it necessary to
      modify his statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, not policemen in particular. I haven't a special down on policemen.
      I like a scrap with anyone. Then he said&mdash;Harlewood, that is&mdash;that
      he admired the way I drove that car down Grafton Street. He said he liked
      a man who wasn't afraid to take risks; which was rot. There wasn't any
      real risk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The police swore that you went at thirty miles an hour," I said. "And
      that street is simply crowded in the middle of the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe I was doing anything like thirty miles an hour," said
      Sam. "I should say twenty-seven at the outside. And there was no risk
      because everybody cleared out of my way. I had the street practically to
      myself. It was rather fun seeing all the other cars and carts and things
      piled up upon the footpaths at either side and the people bolting into the
      shops like rabbits. But there wasn't any risk. However, old Hazlewood
      evidently thought there was, and seemed frightfully pleased about it He
      said he had a car of his own, a sixty h.p. Daimler, and that he'd like to
      see me drive it. I said I'd take him for a spin any time he liked. I gave
      him a hint that we might start immediately after lunch and run up to
      Belfast in time for dinner. With a car like that I could have done it
      easy. However, he wasn't on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think he really had the car?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he had her all right I drove her afterwards. Great Scott, such a
      drive! The next thing he said was that he believed I was a pretty good man
      in a boat. I said I knew something about boats, though not much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Modesty is one of Sam's virtues. He is, I believe, an excellent hand in a
      small yacht, and does a good deal of racing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked him what put it into his head that I could sail a boat, and he
      said O'Meara told him. O'Meara is a man I sail with occasionally, and I
      thought it nice of him to mention my name to this old boy. I can hoist a
      spinnaker all right and shift a jib, but I'm no good at navigation. Always
      did hate sums and always will. I told him that, and he said he could do
      the navigation himself. All he wanted was a good amateur crew for a
      thirty-ton yawl with a motor auxiliary. He had four men, and he asked me
      to make a fifth. I said I'd go like a shot. Strictly speaking, I ought to
      have been attending lectures; but what good are lectures?" "Very little,"
      I said. "In fact, hardly any." "I wasn't going to lose a cruise for the
      sake of any amount of lectures," said Sam, "particularly with the chance
      of a tour on that sixty h.p. car thrown in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam paused at this point. It seemed to me that he wanted encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd have been a fool if you had," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up to that time," said Sam thoughtfully, "I hadn't tumbled to what he was
      at. I give you my word of honour I hadn't the dimmest idea that he was
      after anything in particular. I thought he was simply a good old sport
      with lots of money, which he knew how to spend in sensible ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The criminal part of the business was mentioned later on, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that there's anything criminal about it," said Sam. "I'm
      jolly well sure it wasn't wrong, under the circumstances. But it may have
      been criminal. That's just what I want you to tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give you my opinion," I said, "when I hear what it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gun-running," said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gun-running has for some time been a popular sport in Ireland, and I find
      it very difficult to say whether it is against the law or not. The
      Government goes in for trying to stop it, which looks as if a gun-runner
      might be prosecuted when caught. On the other hand, the Government never
      prosecutes gun-runners, even those who openly boast of their exploits, and
      that looks as if it were quite a legal amusement. I promised Sam that I
      would consider the point, and I asked him to tell me exactly what he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "when I heard it was gunrunning I simply jumped at the
      chance. Any fellow would. I said I'd start right away, if he liked As a
      matter of fact, we didn't start for nearly a fortnight The boat turned out
      to be the <i>Pegeen</i>. You know the <i>Pegeen</i>, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not I am not a sailor, and except that I cannot help seeing
      paragraphs about <i>Shamrock IV</i>. in the daily papers I do not think I
      know the name of a single yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Sam, "she's O'Meara's boat I've sailed in her sometimes in
      cruiser races. She's slow and never does any good, but she's a fine sea
      boat. My idea was that Hazlewood had hired her, and I didn't find out till
      after we had started that O'Meara was on board. That surprised me a bit,
      for O'Meara goes in for being rather an extreme kind of Nationalist&mdash;not
      the sort of fellow you'd expect to be running guns for Carson and the
      Ulster Volunteers. However, I was jolly glad to see him. He crawled out of
      the cabin when we were a couple of miles out of the harbour, and by that
      time I'd have been glad to see anyone who knew one end of the boat from
      the other. Old Hazlewood was all right; but the other three men were
      simply rotters, the sort of fellows who'd be just as likely as not to take
      a pull on a topsail halyard when told to slack away the lee runner. I was
      just making up my mind to work the boat single-handed when O'Meara turned
      up. There was a middling fresh breeze from the west, and we were going
      south on a reach. I didn't get much chance of a talk with O'Meara because
      he was in one watch and I in the other&mdash;had to be, of course, on
      account of being the only two who knew anything about working the boat. I
      did notice, though, that when he spoke to Hazlewood he called him Cassidy.
      However, that was no business of mine. We sailed pretty nearly due south
      that day and the next, and the next after that. Then we hove to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask me another," said Sam. "I told you I couldn't navigate. I hadn't an
      idea within a hundred miles where we were. What's more, I didn't care. I
      was having a splendid time, and had succeeded in knocking some sort of
      sense into the other fellow in my watch. Hazlewood steered, and barring
      that he was sea-sick for eight hours, my man turned out to be a decent
      sort, and fairly intelligent. He said his name was Temple, but Hazlewood
      called him O'Reilly as often as not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to have gone in for a nice variety of names," I said. "What did
      you call yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stuck to my own name, of course. I wasn't doing anything to be ashamed
      of. If we'd been caught and the thing had turned out to be a crime&mdash;I
      don't know whether it was or not, but if it was, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I should have paid your fine," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks," said Sam. "Thanks, awfully. I rather expected you would whenever
      I thought about that part of it, but I very seldom did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What happened when you lay to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing at first. We bumped about a bit for five or six hours, and Temple
      got frightfully sick again. I never saw a man sicker. Harlewood kept on
      muddling about with charts, and doing sums on sheets of paper, and
      consulting with O'Meara. I suppose they wanted to make sure that they'd
      got to the right place. At last, just about sunset, a small steamer turned
      up. She hung about all night, and next day we started early, about four
      o'clock, and got the guns out of her, or some of them. We couldn't take
      the whole cargo, of course, in a 30-ton yacht I don't know how many more
      guns she had. Perhaps she hadn't any more. Only our little lot Anyhow, I
      was jolly glad when the job was over. There was a bit of a roll&mdash;nothing
      much, you know, but quite enough to make it pretty awkward. Temple got
      over his sea-sickness, which was a comfort. I suppose the excitement cured
      him. The way we worked was this&mdash;but I daresay you wouldn't
      understand, even if I told you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it very technical? I mean, must you use many sea words?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must," said Sam. "We were at sea, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," I said, "perhaps you'd better leave that part out. Tell me what
      you did with the guns when you'd got them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right It was there the fun really came in. Not that I'm complaining about
      the other part. It was sport all right, but the funny part, the part
      you'll like, came later. What <i>about</i> another cigar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I rang the bell, and got two more cigars for Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had rather a tiresome passage home," he said. "It kept on falling
      calm, and O'Meara's motor isn't very powerful. It took us a clear week to
      work our way up to the County Down coast It was there we landed, in a poky
      little harbour. We went in at night, and had to wait for a full tide to
      get in at all. We got the sails of the boat outside, and just strolled in,
      so to speak, with the wretched little engine doing about half it could.
      Hazlewood told me that he expected four motor-cars to meet us, and that I
      was to take one of them, and drive like hell into County Armagh. There I
      was to call at a house belonging to O'Meara, and hand over my share of the
      guns. He said he hoped I knew my way about those parts, because it would
      be awkward for me trying to work with road maps when I ought to drive
      fast. I said I knew that country like the palm of my hand. The governor's
      parish is up there, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam certainly ought to know County Down. He was brought up there, and must
      have walked, cycled, and driven over most of the roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The only thing I didn't know," said Sam, "was O'Meara's house. I'd never
      heard of his having a house in that part of the country. However, he said
      he'd only taken it lately, and that when I got over the border into Armagh
      there'd be a man waiting to show me where to go. He told me the road I was
      to take and I knew every turn of the way, so I felt pretty sure of getting
      there. It was about two in the morning when we got alongside the pier. The
      four motors were there all right, but there wasn't a soul about except the
      men in charge of them. We got out the guns. They were done up in small
      bundles and the cartridges in handy little cases; but it took us till
      half-past four o'clock to get them ashore. By that time there were a few
      people knocking about; but they didn't seem to want to interfere with us.
      In fact, some of them came and helped us to pack the stuff into the cars.
      They were perfectly friendly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That doesn't surprise me in the least," I said "The people up there are
      nearly all Protestants. Most of them were probably Volunteers themselves.
      I daresay it wasn't the first cargo they'd helped to land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the first cargo they ever helped to land for the National
      Volunteers," said Sam with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The National Volunteers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I admit that Sam startled me. I do not suppose that he has any political
      convictions. At the age of twenty a man has a few prejudices but no
      convictions. If he is a young fellow who goes in for being intellectual
      they are prejudices against the party his father belonged to. If&mdash;and
      this is Sam's case&mdash;he is a healthy-minded young man, who enjoys
      sport, he takes over his father's opinions as they stand, and regards
      everybody who does not accept them as an irredeemable blackguard. The Dean
      is a very strong loyalist. He is the chaplain of an Orange Lodge, and has
      told me more than once that he hopes to march to battle at the head of his
      regiment of Volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smuggling arms for the Nationalists!" I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I did," said Sam, grinning broadly. "But I thought all the
      time that I was working for the other side. I didn't know the Nationalists
      went in for guns; thought they only talked. In fact, to tell you the
      truth, I forgot all about them. Otherwise I wouldn't have done it At least
      I mightn't. But I had a great time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," I said, "I don't mind. So far as I am concerned personally
      I'd rather neither side had any guns. But if your father finds out, Sam,
      there'll be a frightful row. He'll disown you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The governor knows all about it," said Sam, "and he doesn't mind one bit.
      Just wait till you hear the end of the story. You'll be as surprised as I
      was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly shall," I said, "if the story ends in your father's approving
      of your smuggling guns for rebels. He'd call them rebels, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Sam, "as far as rebellion goes I don't see that there's much to
      choose between them. However, that doesn't matter. What happened was this.
      I got off with my load about five o'clock, and I had a gorgeous spin.
      There wasn't a cart or a thing on the roads, and I just let the car rip. I
      touched sixty miles an hour, and hardly ever dropped below forty. Best run
      I ever had. Almost the only thing I passed was a motor lorry, going the
      same way I was. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but it turned
      out to be important afterwards. It was about seven o'clock when I got out
      of County Down into Armagh. I began looking out for the fellow who was to
      meet me. It wasn't long before I spotted him, standing at a corner, trying
      to look as if he were a military sentry. You know the sort of thing I
      mean. Bandolier, belt, and frightfully stiff about the back. He held up
      his hand and I stopped. 'A loyal man,' he said. Well, I was, so far as I
      knew at that time, so I said 'You bet.' 'That's not right,' said he. 'Give
      the countersign.' I hadn't heard anything about a countersign, so I told
      him not to be a damned fool, and that I'd break his head if he said I
      wasn't a loyal man. That seemed to puzzle him a bit He got out a notebook
      and read a page or two, looking at me and the car every now and then as if
      he wasn't quite satisfied. I felt pretty sure, of course, that he was the
      man I wanted. He couldn't very well be anyone else. So by way of cutting
      the business short I told him I was loaded up with guns and cartridges,
      and that I wished he'd hop in and show me where to go. 'That's all very
      fine,' he said, 'but you oughtn't to be in a car like that' I told him
      there was no use arguing about the car. I wasn't going back to change it
      to please him. He asked me who I was, and I told him, mentioning that I
      was the governor's son. I thought that might help him to make up his mind,
      and it did. The governor is middling well known up in those parts, and the
      mention of his name was enough. The fellow climbed in beside me. We hadn't
      very far to go, as it turned out, and in the inside of twenty minutes I
      was driving up the avenue of a big house. The size of it rather surprised
      me, for I didn't think O'Meara was well enough off to keep up a place of
      the kind. However, I was evidently expected, for I was shown into the
      dining-room by a footman. There were three men at breakfast, my old dad,
      Dopping&mdash;you know Dopping, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dopping is a retired cavalry colonel. I do business for him and know him
      pretty well He is just the sort of man who would be in the thick of any
      gun-running that was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was another man," said Sam, "whom I didn't know and wasn't
      introduced to. The fact is there wasn't much time for politeness. My dad
      looked as if he'd been shot when he saw me, and old Dopping bristled all
      over like an Irish terrier at the beginning of a fight, and asked me who
      the devil I was and what I was doing there. Of course, he jolly well knew
      who I was, and I thought he must know what brought me there, so I just
      winked by way of letting him understand that I was in the game. He got so
      red in the face that I thought he'd burst Then the other man chipped in
      and asked me what I'd got in the car. The three of them whispered together
      for a bit, and I suggested that if they didn't believe me they'd better go
      and see. The car was outside the door, and their own man was sitting on
      the guns. Dopping went, and I suppose he told the other two that the guns
      were there all right Dad asked me where I got them, and I told them,
      mentioning Hazlewood's name and the name of the yacht I was a bit puzzled,
      but I still thought everything was all right, and that there'd be no harm
      in mentioning names. I very soon saw that there was some sort of mistake
      somewhere. The governor and old Dopping and the other man, who seemed to
      be the coolest of the three, went over to the window and looked at the
      car. Then they started whispering again, and I couldn't hear a word they
      said. Didn't want to. I was as hungry as a wolf, and there was a jolly
      good breakfast on the table. I sat down and gorged. I had just started my
      third egg when the door opened, and a rather nice-looking young fellow
      walked in. The footman came behind him, looking as white as a sheet, and
      began some sort of apology for letting the stranger in. Old Dopping, who
      was still in a pretty bad temper, told the footman to go and be damned.
      Then the new man introduced himself. He said he was Colonel O'Connell, of
      the first Armagh Regiment of National Volunteers. I expected to see old
      Dopping kill him at sight Dopping is a tremendous loyalist, and the other
      fellow&mdash;well&mdash;phew!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam whistled. Words failed him, I suppose, when it came to expressing the
      disloyalty of a colonel of National Volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Instead of that," said Sam, "Dopping stood up straight, and saluted
      O'Connell. O'Connell stiffened his back, and saluted Dopping. The third
      man, the one I didn't know, stood up, too, and saluted. O'Connell saluted
      him. Then the governor bowed quite civilly, and O'Connell saluted him. I
      can tell you it was a pretty scene. 'I beg to inform you, gentlemen,' said
      O'Connell, 'that a consignment of rifles and ammunition, apparently
      intended for your force, has arrived at our headquarters in a motor
      lorry.' Nothing could have been civiller than the way he spoke. But
      Dopping was not to be beat He's a bristly old bear at times, but he always
      was a gentleman. 'Owing to a mistake,' he said, 'some arms, evidently
      belonging to you, are now in a car at our door.' The governor and the
      other man sat down and laughed till they were purple, but neither
      O'Connell nor old Dopping so much as smiled. It was then&mdash;and I give
      you my word not till then&mdash;that I tumbled to the idea that I'd been
      running guns for the other side. I expected that there'd be a furious row
      the minute the governor stopped laughing. But there wasn't In fact, no one
      took any notice of me. There was a long consultation, and in the end they
      settled that it might be risky to start moving the guns about again, and
      that each party had better stick to what it had got. Our fellows&mdash;I
      call them our fellows, though, of course, I was really acting for the
      others&mdash;our fellows got rather the better of the exchange in the way
      of ammunition. But O'Connell scooped in a lot of extra rifles. When they
      had that settled they all saluted again, and the governor said something
      about hoping to meet O'Connell at Philippi. I don't know what he meant by
      that, but O'Connell seemed tremendously pleased. Where do you suppose
      Philippi is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Philippi," I said, "is where somebody&mdash;Julius Caesar, I think, but
      it doesn't matter&mdash;&mdash; What your father meant was that he hoped
      to have a chance of fighting it out with O'Connell some day. Not a duel,
      you know, but a proper battle. The Ulster Volunteers against the other
      lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall have to wipe out the police first," said Sam, "to prevent their
      interfering. I hope I shall be there then. I want to get my own back out
      of those fellows who collared me from behind the day of the last rag. But,
      I say, what about the soldiers&mdash;the regular soldiers, I mean? Which
      side will they be on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," I said, "is the one uncertain factor in the problem. Nobody
      knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best plan," said Sam, "would be to take them away altogether, and
      leave us to settle the matter ourselves. We'd do it all right, judging by
      the way old Dopping and O'Connell behaved to each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings. I should never have suspected
      Sam of profound political wisdom. But it is quite possible that his
      suggestion would meet the case better than any other.

      Lord Dunseverick picked his way delicately among the pools and tough
      cobble stones. He was a very well-dressed young man, and he seemed out of
      place amid the miry traffic of the Belfast quays. A casual observer would
      have put him down as a fashionable nincompoop, one of those young men
      whose very appearance is supposed to move the British worker to outbursts
      of socialistic fury. The casual observer would, in this case, have been
      mistaken. Lord Dunseverick, in spite of his well-fitting clothes, his
      delicately coloured tie, and his general air of sleek well-being, was at
      that moment&mdash;it was the month of May, 1914&mdash;something of a hero
      with the Belfast working man. And the Belfast working man, as everybody
      knows, is more bitterly contemptuous of the idle rich, especially of the
      idle rich with titles, than any other working man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Belfast working man had just then worked himself up to a degree of
      martial ardour, unprecedented even in Ulster, in his opposition to Home
      Rule. Lord Dunseverick was one of the generals of the Ulster Volunteer
      Force. He had made several speeches which moved Belfast to wild delight
      and sober-minded men elsewhere to dubious shaking of the head. Enthusiasm
      in a cause is a fine thing, especially in the young, but when Lord
      Dunseverick's enthusiasm led him to say that he would welcome the German
      Emperor at the head of his legions as the deliverer of Ulster from the
      tyranny of a Parliament in Dublin, why then&mdash;then the rank and file
      of the volunteer army cheered, and other people wondered whether it were
      quite wise to say such things. Yet Lord Dunseverick, when not actually
      engaged in making a speech, was a pleasant and agreeable young man with a
      keen sense of humour. He even&mdash;and this is a rare quality in men&mdash;saw
      the humorous side of his own speeches. The trouble was that he never saw
      it till after he had made them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy motor-lorry came thundering along the quay. Lord Dunseverick
      dodged it, and escaped with his life. He was splashed from head to foot
      with mud. He looked at his neat boots and well-fashioned grey trousers.
      The blade slime lay thick on them. He wiped a spot of mud off his cheek
      and rubbed some wet coal dust into his collar. Then he lit a cigarette,
      and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into the porch of a reeking public-house and found himself
      beside a grizzled man, who looked like a sailor. Lord Dunseverick turned
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you tell me," he said, "where Mr. McMunn's office is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it coal you're wanting?" asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is thus that questions are often met in Belfast with counter-questions.
      Belfast is a city of business men, and it is not the habit of business men
      to give away anything, even information, without getting something in
      return. The counter-question may draw some valuable matter by way of
      answer from the original questioner. In this case the counter-question was
      a reasonable one. McMunn, of McMunn Brothers, Limited, was a coal
      merchant. Lord Dunseverick, though a peer, belonged to the north of
      Ireland. He understood Belfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I want," he said, "is to see Mr. Andrew McMunn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've business with Andrew McMunn myself," said the sailor, "and I'm going
      that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Then we'll go together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name," said the sailor, "is Ginty. If you're intimate with Andrew
      McMunn you'll likely have heard of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't But that's no reason why you shouldn't show me the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no that far," said Ginty.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked together, sometimes side by side, sometimes driven apart by a
      string of carts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it had been Jimmy McMunn you wanted to see," said Ginty, "you might
      have had further to go. Some says Jimmy's in the one place, and more is of
      opinion that he's in the other. But I've no doubt in my own mind about
      where Andrew will go when his time comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know him pretty well, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, I do. It would be queer if I didn't, seeing that I've sailed his
      ships this ten year. Andrew McMunn will go to heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Lord Dunseverick, "he's a good man, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll no go so far as to say precisely that," said Ginty, "but he's a man
      who never touches a drop of whisky nor smokes a pipe of tobacco. It'll be
      very hard on him if he doesna go to heaven after all he's missed in this
      world. But you'll find out what kind of man he is if you go in through the
      door forninst you. It's his office, thon's one with the brass plate on the
      door. My business will keep till you're done with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dunseverick pushed open one of a pair of swinging doors, and found
      himself in a narrow passage. On his right was a ground glass window
      bearing the word "Inquiries." He tapped at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or two there was no response. Lord Dunseverick brushed some
      of the mud, now partially dry, off his trousers, and lit a fresh
      cigarette. The ground glass window was opened, and a redhaired clerk
      looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see Mr. McMunn," said Lord Dunseverick, "Mr. Andrew McMunn."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk put his head and shoulders out through the window, and surveyed
      Lord Dunseverick suspiciously. Very well dressed young men, with pale
      lavender ties and pearl tie-pins&mdash;Lord Dunseverick had both&mdash;are
      not often seen in Belfast quay-side offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you want to see Mr. McMunn," said the clerk, "&mdash;and I'm no saying
      you will, mind that&mdash;you'd better take yon cigarette out of your
      mouth. There's no smoking allowed here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dunseverick took his cigarette out of his mouth, but he did not throw
      it away. He held it between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just tell Mr. McMunn," he said, "that Lord Dunseverick is here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk's manner altered suddenly. He drew himself up, squared his
      shoulders, and saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery that a stranger is a man of high rank often produces this
      kind of effect on men of strong democratic principles, principles of the
      kind held by clerks in all business communities, quite as firmly in
      Belfast as elsewhere. But it would have been a mistake to suppose that Mr.
      McMunn's junior clerk was a mere worshipper of title. His salute was not
      the tribute of a snob to the representative of an aristocratic class. It
      was the respect due by a soldier, drilled and disciplined, to his superior
      officer. It was also the expression of a young man's sincere hero-worship.
      The redhaired clerk was a Volunteer, duly enrolled, one of the signatories
      of the famous Ulster Covenant Lord Dunseverick had made speeches which
      moved his soul to actual rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come inside, my lord," he said. "I'll inform Mr. McMunn at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dunseverick passed through a door which was held open for him. He
      entered a large office, very grimy, which is the proper condition of a
      place where documents concerning coal are dealt with. Six other clerks
      were at work there. When Lord Dunseverick entered, all six of them stood
      up and saluted. They, too, so it appeared, were members of the Volunteer
      Force. The red-haired junior clerk crossed the room towards a door marked
      "Private." Then he paused, and turned to Lord Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might I be so bold as to ask a question?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dozen if you like," said Lord Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about the rifles? It's only them we're wanting now. We're drilled
      and we're ready, but where's the rifles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have them," said Lord Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerks in Mr. McMunn's office were accustomed to behave with decorum.
      No more than a low murmur of approval greeted Lord Dunseverick's words;
      but the men looked as if they wished to cheer vehemently. The red-haired
      boy tapped at the door which was marked "Private." A minute later he
      invited Lord Dunseverick to pass through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew McMunn is a hard-faced, grizzled little man, with keen blue eyes.
      He can, when he chooses, talk excellent English. He prefers, when dealing
      with strangers, to speak with a strong Belfast accent, and to use, if
      possible, north of Ireland words and phrases. This is his way of asserting
      independence of character. He admires independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His office is a singularly unattractive room. He writes at a large table,
      and has a fireproof safe at his elbow. There are three wooden chairs
      ranged against the wall opposite the writing-table. Four photographs of
      steamers, cheaply framed, hang above the chairs. They are <i>The Andrew
      McMunn, The Eliza McMunn</i>, and, a tribute to the deceased Jimmy, <i>The
      McMunn Brothers</i>. These form the fleet owned by the firm, and carry
      coal from one port to another, chiefly to Belfast. On the chimney-piece
      under a glass shade, is a model of <i>The McMunn Brothers</i>, the latest
      built and largest of the ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning to you, my lord!" said McMunn, without rising from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded towards one of the chairs which stood against the wall. This was
      his way of inviting his visitor to sit down. His eyes were fixed, with
      strong disapproval, on the cigarette, which still smoked feebly in Lord
      Dunseverick's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your clerk gave me a hint," said Dunseverick, "that you object to
      tobacco."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my opinion," said McMunn, "that the man who pays taxes that he
      needn't pay&mdash;I'm alluding to the duty on tobacco, you'll understand&mdash;for
      the sake of poisoning himself with a nasty stink, is little better than a
      fool. That's my opinion, and I'm of the same way of thinking about
      alcoholic drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dunseverick deposited the offending cigarette on the hearth and
      crushed it with his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Teetotaller?" he said. "I dare say you're right, though I take a
      whisky-and-soda myself when I get the chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll no get it here," said McMunn; "and what's more, you'll no' get it
      on any ship owned by me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. It's as well to understand before-hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a believer in speaking plain," said McMunn. "There's ay less chance
      of trouble afterwards if a man speaks plain at the start. But I'm thinking
      that it wasn't to hear my opinion on the Christian religion that your
      lordship came here the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      McMunn, besides being a teetotaller, and opposed to the smoking of
      tobacco, was the president of a Young Men's Anti-Gambling League. He was,
      therefore, in a position to throw valuable light on the Christian
      religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came to settle the details about this expedition to Hamburg," said Lord
      Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said McMunn, "there's no that much left to settle. <i>The Brothers</i>
      is ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>The Brothers?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>The McMunn Brothers</i>. Thon's the model of her on the chimneypiece."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dunseverick looked at the model attentively. It represented a very
      unattractive ship. Her bow was absurdly high, cocked up like the snout of
      a Yorkshire pig. Her long waist lay low, promising little freeboard in a
      sea. Her engines and single funnel were aft. On a short, high quarterdeck
      was her bridge and a squat deck-house. She was designed, like her owner,
      for purely business purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have the captain's cabin," said McMunn. "Him and me will sleep in
      the saloon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you're coming too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am. Have you any objection?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None whatever. I'm delighted. We'll have a jolly time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have you remember," said McMunn, "that it's not pleasuring we're out
      for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's serious business. Smuggling rifles in the teeth of a Royal
      Proclamation is&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I understand," said McMunn, "and you understand, where's the use of
      saying what we're going for? I'm taking risks enough anyway, without
      unnecessary talking. You never know who's listening to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About paying for the&mdash;er&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;our cargo? Is that
      all arranged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll be paid in bills on a Hamburg bank," said McMunn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't they expect cash? I should have thought that in transactions of
      this kind&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not a business man, my lord; but I'd have you know that a bill
      with the name of McMunn to it is the same as cash in any port in Europe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's your part of the affair. I am leaving that to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may leave it What I say I'll do. But there's one thing that I'm no
      quite easy in my mind about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you're thinking about the landing of the guns&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm no asking what arrangements you've made about that. The fewer there
      is that knows what's being done in a business of this kind, the better for
      all concerned. What's bothering me is this. There's a man called
      Edelstein."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's he? I never heard of him before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's the Baron von Edelstein, if that's any help to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't. He's not the man we're buying the stuff from."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is not. Nor he wasn't mentioned from first to last till the letter I
      got the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the safe beside him and drew out a bundle of papers held
      together by an elastic band.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the whole of the correspondence," he said, "and there's the last
      of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed a letter to Lord Dunseverick, who read it through carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This baron," he said, "whoever he is, intends to pay his respects to us
      before we leave Hamburg. Very civil of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a civility we could do without. When I'm doing business I'd rather
      do it with business men, and a baron, you'll understand, is no just&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a baron myself," said Lord Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      McMunn said no more. He left it to be understood that his opinion of
      barons in general was not improved by his acquaintance with Lord
      Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think we need bother about Von Eddstein, anyway," said Lord
      Dunseverick. "What harm can he do us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm no precisely bothering about him," said McMunn; "but I'd be easier in
      my mind if I knew what he wanted with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We sail to-night, anyway," said Lord Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, we do. I tell't Ginty. He's the captain of <i>The McMunn Brothers</i>,
      and a good man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've met him. In fact&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you've met Ginty you've met a man who knows his business, though I
      wish he'd give over drinking whisky. However, he's a strong Protestant and
      a sound man, and you can't expect perfection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital!" said Lord Dunseverick. "It's a great comfort to be sure of
      one's men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I was as sure of every one as I am of Ginty," said McMunn. "I'm no
      saying that your lordship's not sound. The speech you made last night at
      Ballymena was good enough, and I'm with you in every word of it; but&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, speeches!" said Lord Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was uneasily conscious that he had allowed himself to be carried away
      by the excitement of the occasion when speaking at Ballymena. It was right
      and proper to threaten armed resistance to Home Rule. It was another thing
      to offer a warm welcome to the German Emperor if he chose to land in
      Ulster. The cold emphasis with which McMunn expressed agreement with every
      word of the speech made Lord Dunseverick vaguely uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said McMunn; "your speeches are well enough, and I don't say, mind
      you, that you're not a sound man; but I'd be better pleased if you were
      more serious. You're too fond of joking, in my opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" said Lord Dunseverick. "I haven't ventured on the ghost of
      a joke since I came into your office!" He looked round him as he spoke,
      and fixed his eyes at last on the fireproof safe. "Nobody could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no what you've said, it's your lordship's appearance. But it's too
      late to alter that, I'm thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said Lord Dunseverick. "I'll join you this evening in a suit
      of yellow oilskins, the stickiest kind, and a blue fisherman's jersey, and
      a pair of sea-boots. I'll have&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will," said McMunn, "and you'll look like a play actor. It's just
      what I'm complaining of."
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>The McMunn Brothers</i> lay, with steam up, at a single anchor a mile
      below the Hamburg quays. The yellow, turbid waters of the Elbe swept past
      her sides. Below her stretched the long waterway which leads to the North
      Sea. The lights of the buoys which marked the channel twinkled dimly in
      the gloom of the summer evening. Shafts of brighter light swept across and
      across the water from occulting beacons set at long intervals among buoys.
      Above the steamer lay a large Norwegian barque waiting for her pilot to
      take her down on the ebb tide. Below <i>The McMunn Brothers</i> was an
      ocean-going tramp steamer. One of her crew sat on the forecastle playing
      the "Swanee River" on a melodeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      McMunn, Ginty, and Lord Dunseverick were together in the cabin of <i>The
      McMunn Brothers</i>. McMunn, dressed precisely as he always dressed in his
      office, sat bolt upright on the cabin sofa. In front of him on the table
      were some papers, which he turned over and looked at from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside him was Ginty, in his shirt sleeves, with his peaked cap pushed far
      back on his head. He sat with his elbows on the table. His chin, thrust
      forward, rested on his knuckles. He stared fixedly at the panelling on the
      opposite wall of the cabin. Lord Dunseverick, who had a side of the table
      to himself, leaned far back. His legs were stretched out straight in front
      of him. His hands were in his pockets. He gazed wearily at the small lamp
      which swung from the cabin roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time no one spoke. It was Lord Dunseverick who broke the
      silence in the end. He took his cigarette-case from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may say what you like about tobacco, McMunn," he said, "but it's a
      comfort to a man when he has no company but a bear with a sore head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said McMunn, "you'll smoke and you'll smoke, but you'll no make me
      any easier in my mind by smoking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ginty drew a plug of black tobacco from his pocket, and began cutting
      shreds from it with a clasp knife. He was apparently of opinion that
      smoking would relieve the strain on <i>his</i> mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm no satisfied," said McMunn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see what you have to grumble about," said Lord Dunseverick.
      "We've got what we came for, and we've got our clearance papers. What more
      do you want? You expected trouble about those papers, and there wasn't
      any. You ought to be pleased."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you have it," said McMunn. "According to all the laws of nature
      there ought to have been trouble. With a cargo like ours there ought to
      have been a lot of trouble. Instead of that the papers are handed over to
      us without a question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's peculiar," said Ginty. "It's very peculiar, and that's a fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there's the matter of those extra cases," said McMunn. "How many
      cases is there in the hold, Ginty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hundred, seventy-two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the contract was for one-fifty. What's in the odd twenty-two? Tell me
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pianos," said Lord Dunseverick. "Look at your clearance papers. 'Nature
      of Cargo&mdash;Pianos.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd have your joke," said McMunn, "if the flames of hell were scorching
      the soles of your boots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's peculiar," said Ginty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's more than peculiar," said McMunn. "I've been in business for thirty
      years, and it's the first time I ever had goods given me that I didn't ask
      for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Lord Dunseverick, "if we've got an extra five hundred rifles
      we can't complain. There's plenty of men in Ulster ready to use them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe you'll tell me," said McMunn, "why they wouldn't let me pay for the
      goods in the office this afternoon. Did anyone ever hear the like of that&mdash;a
      man refusing money that was due to him, and it offered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's out of the course of nature," said Ginty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They told you," said Lord Dunseverick, "that you could pay Von Edelstein,
      and he'd give you a receipt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Von Edelstein. And where's Von Edelstein?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's coming on board this evening," said Lord Dunseverick. "But you
      needn't wait for him unless you like. We've got steam up. Why not slip
      away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it's no my way of doing business," said McMunn, "to slip away, as
      you call it, without paying for what I've got I'm a man of principle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Talking of your principles," said Lord Dunseverick, "what did you bring
      on board in that basket this afternoon? It looked to me like beer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was beer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad to hear it," said Lord Dunseverick. "Let's have a couple of
      bottles."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ginty took his pipe from his mouth and grinned pleasantly. He wanted beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be thinking maybe," said McMunn, "that I'm going back on my
      temperance principles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We don't think anything of the sort," said Lord Dunseverick. "We think
      that foreign travel has widened your principles out a bit That's what we
      think, isn't it, Ginty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My principles are what they always were," said McMunn, "but I've some
      small share of commonsense. I know there's a foreigner coming on board the
      night, a baron and a dissipated man&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, now,'" said Lord Dunseverick, "you can't be sure that Von Edelstein
      is dissipated. You've never met him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a foreigner and a baron," said McMunn, "and that's enough for me,
      forbye that he's coming here under very suspicious circumstances. If I can
      get the better of him by means of strong drink and the snare of alcoholic
      liquors&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord!" said Lord Dunseverick. "You don't expect to make a German
      drunk with half a dozen bottles of lager beer, particularly as Ginty and I
      mean to drink two each."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a dozen in the basket. And, under the circumstances, I consider
      myself justified I'm no man for tricks, but if there's any tricks to be
      played, I'd rather play them myself than have them played on me. Mind that
      now. It's the way I've always acted, and it's no a bad way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh," said Ginty, "there's somebody coming aboard of us now. The
      look-out man's hailing him."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the cabin as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Ginty entered the cabin again. He was followed by a
      tall man, so tall that he could not stand quite upright in the little
      cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the baron," said Ginty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Guten Abend</i>," said McMunn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He possessed some twenty more German words, and knew that "beer" was
      represented by the same sound as in English. The equipment seemed to him
      sufficient for the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the good fortune to speak English easily," said Von Edelstein. "Am
      I addressing myself to Mr. McMunn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said McMunn, "you are. And this is Lord Dunseverick, a baron like
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Edelstein bowed, and held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I prefer," he said, "my military title, Captain von Edelstein. I believe
      that Lord Dunseverick also has a military title. Should I say colonel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact," said Lord Dunseverick, "I'm not in the Army."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," said Von Edelstein. "You are in the Volunteers, the Ulster
      Volunteers. But, perhaps I should say general?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't call myself that," said Lord Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact, my rank is not officially recognized, in England, I
      mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but here&mdash;we recognize it I assure you, general, we regard the
      Ulster Volunteers as a properly constituted military force."
    </p>
    <p>
      McMunn had been groping in a locker behind him. He interrupted Von
      Edelstein by setting a basket on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beer," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Edelstein bowed, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ginty," said McMunn, "get some tumblers. And now Baron&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain," said Von Edelstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well get to business. What's in them twenty-two cases that was dumped
      into our hold today?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Von Edelstein, smiling. "A little surprise. I hope, I feel
      confident, a pleasant surprise, for my comrades of the Ulster Volunteer
      Force."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ginty entered the cabin carrying three tumblers and a corkscrew. The beer
      was opened and poured out Von Edelstein raised his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the Ulster Volunteer Force," he said, "and to the day when the
      pleasant little surprise we have prepared for you may prove a very
      unpleasant surprise for&mdash;the enemy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed and drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's in them cases?" said McMunn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen," said Von Edelstein, "something that will be of great value to
      you&mdash;machine guns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We didn't order them," said McMunn, "and I'm not going to pay for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not authorized," said Von Edelstein, "to reveal secrets of State;
      but I think I may trust your discretion so far as to say that one very
      highly placed desires that the Ulster Volunteer Force should be thoroughly
      equipped for war. It is his wish:&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baron," said McMunn, "here's a bill drawn on my firm for the price of the
      rifles. I'll trouble you for a receipt, and in the matter of the contents
      of them cases&mdash;I don't say they're not machine guns, but I've no way
      of knowing at present. If it turns out that they're any use to us we may
      strike a bargain, but I'll no pay for a pig in a poke."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid his bill and a form of receipt on the table. Von Edelstein pushed
      them aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen," he said, "between comrades in arms there is no question of
      payment. It is the wish of one who is very highly placed that your army&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But look here," said Lord Dunseverick, "we are not comrades in arms, as
      you call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Von Edelstein. "Not to-day, not to-morrow perhaps. But who
      knows how soon? When the word is given, and some batteries of our
      artillery land in Belfast to support your excellent infantry&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" said Ginty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a regiment of Prussian Guards&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be no Prussians in Belfast," said Ginty, "for we'll not have
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid," said Lord Dunseverick, "that you've got some wrong idea
      into your head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Von Edelstein, "you cannot fight alone. You would be&mdash;what
      do you call it?&mdash;you would be wiped out Even the English Army could
      do that. You have no artillery. You have no cavalry. What are you but&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who said we were going to fight the English Army?" said Lord Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you think we're a pack of dirty rebels," said Ginty, "you're making a
      big mistake. We're loyal men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if you are not going to fight the English," said Von Edelstein, "God
      in heaven, who are you going to fight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young man," said McMunn, "you're drinking beer in my ship, a thing which
      is clean contrary to my principles, though I'm putting up with it; but
      you're going beyond the beyonds when you sit here and take the name of the
      Almighty in vain. I'll trouble you not to swear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Edelstein stared at him in blank amazement Then very slowly a look of
      intelligence came over his face. He turned to Lord Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I understand," he said. "You do not quite trust me. You fear that
      I may be a spy in the pay of infamous Englishmen. But you are mistaken&mdash;entirely
      mistaken. I offer you proof of my good faith. General, be so kind as to
      read my commission."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a folded document from his pocket, and spread it out before Lord
      Dunseverick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is signed," he said, "as you see, by the Emperor himself. It places my
      services, the services of Captain von Edelstein, of the Prussian Guard, at
      the disposal of the Ulster Volunteer Force, as military organiser."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dunseverick glanced at the document before him. He read parts of it
      with close attention. He laid his finger on the signature as if to
      convince himself by actual touch that it really was what it seemed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," said Von Edelstein, "I am to be trusted. When you and I are
      fighting side by side against the cursed English, your enemies and ours&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Edelstein was still smiling. What happened then happened in an instant
      Lord Dunseverick struck the German full on the mouth with his fist Von
      Edelstein's head went back. His hands clutched convulsively at the
      tablecloth. Before he had recovered, Lord Dunseverick hit him again, beat
      him down on the cabin sofa, and struck blow after blow at his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You infernal scoundrel," he said, "do you take me for a traitor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quit it," said McMunn. "Quit it when I tell you. You cannot kill the man
      with your naked fists, and you'll break the furniture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ginty drew a long coil of rope from a locker. He tied up Von Edelstein and
      laid him, a helpless figure, on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my opinion," said McMunn, "that we'd better be getting out to sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking the same," said Ginty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on deck. Soon <i>The McMunn Brothers</i> was under way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dunseverick looked at the prostrate Von Edelstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are we going to do with him?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drown him," said McMunn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trickle of blood was running down Von Edelstein's chin. He spat out some
      fragments of broken teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It appears," he said, "that I have made a mistake about your intentions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've offered an outrageous insult to loyal men," said McMunn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mistake," said Von Edelstein, "but surely excusable. I have in my
      pocket at the present moment&mdash;would you be so kind as to feel in my
      breast pocket? You'll find some papers there, and a newspaper cutting
      among them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dunseverick slipped his hand into the prisoner's pocket. He drew out
      a number of letters and a newspaper cutting. It was a report, taken from
      the <i>Belfast News Letter</i>, of the speech which he had made at
      Ballymena a fortnight before. He had proclaimed the Kaiser the deliverer
      of Ulster. His own words stared him in the face. McMunn took the cutting
      and glanced at it. He thumped his fist on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stand by every word of it," he said. "We will not have Home Rule."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a curious people," said Von Edelstein. "I thought&mdash;and even
      now you say&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That speech," said McMunn, "was made for an entirely different purpose.
      If you thought that we wanted a German Army in Ulster, or that we meant to
      fire on the British flag&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is exactly what I did think," said Von Edelstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a born fool, then," said McMunn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said Lord Dunseverick, "we ought not to drown him. Suppose we
      take him home, and hand him over to the Ulster Provisional Government?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you would," said Von Edelstein, "I am a student of human nature. I
      should greatly like to meet your Ulster Government."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll maybe not like it so much when they hang you," said McMunn, "and
      it's what they'll do."

    <h2>
      XI ~~ SIR TIMOTHY'S DINNER-PARTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Courtney, the R.M., was a man of ideas, and prided himself on his
      sympathy with progress, the advance of thought, and similar delights. If
      he had been thirty years younger, and had lived in Dublin, he would have
      been classed among the "Intellectuals." He would then have written a
      gloomy play or two, several poems and an essay, published at a shilling,
      in a green paper cover, on the "Civilization of the Future." Being,
      unfortunately, fifty-five years of age, he could not write poetry or
      gloomy plays. Nobody can after the age of forty. Being a Resident
      Magistrate, he was debarred from discussing the Civilization of the Future
      in print. No Government allows its paid servant to write books on
      controversial subjects. But Mr. Courtney remained intellectually alert,
      and was a determined champion of the cause of progress, even amid the
      uncongenial society of a West of Ireland town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The introduction of Summer Time gave Mr. Courtney a great opportunity.
      Almost everyone else in the neighbourhood objected to the change of the
      clock. Cows, it was said, disliked being milked before their accustomed
      hour. Dew collects in deep pools, and renders farm work impossible in the
      early morning. It is unreasonable to expect labourers, who have to rise
      early in any case, to get out of their beds before the day is properly
      warm. Mr. Courtney combated all these objections with arguments which
      struck him as sound, but irritated everybody else. When it appeared that
      Ireland, worse treated as usual than England, was to be fined an
      additional twenty-five minutes, and was to lose the proud privilege of
      Irish time, Mr. Courtney was more pleased than ever. He made merry over
      what he called the arguments of reactionary patriotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Timothy was the principal landlord, and, socially, the most important
      person in the neighbourhood. Sir Timothy did not like Mr. Courtney. He was
      of opinion that the R.M. was inclined to take a high hand at Petty
      Sessions and to bully the other magistrates&mdash;Sir Timothy was himself
      a magistrate&mdash;who sat with him on the Bench. He also thought that Mr.
      Courtney was "too d&mdash;&mdash;d superior" in private life. Sir Timothy
      had the lowest possible opinion of the progress made by civilization in
      his own time. The Civilization of the Future, about which Mr. Courtney
      talked a great deal, seemed to Sir Timothy a nasty kind of nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural, almost inevitable, that Sir Timothy should take a
      conservative view on the subject of the new time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see the use of playing silly tricks with the clock," he said.
      "You might just as well say that I'd live ten years longer if everybody
      agreed to say that I'm forty-eight instead of fifty-eight. I'd still be
      fifty-eight in reality. It's just the same with the time. We may all make
      up our minds to pretend it's eight o'clock when it's really seven, but it
      will still be seven."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Courtney smiled in a gentle, but very annoying manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Sir Timothy," he said, "don't you see that what is really wanted
      is a complete change in the habits of the population? We've been gradually
      slipping into wasteful ways of living. Our expenditure on artificial light&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know all about that," said Sir Timothy. "If you've said it to me once,
      you've said it a dozen times, and last year I did alter my docks. But this
      year&mdash;hang it all! They're sticking another twenty-five minutes on
      it. If they go on at this rate, moving us back an extra half hour every
      May, we'll be living in the middle of the night before we die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry to hear you taking up that question of the so-called Irish
      time," said Mr. Courtney. "Reactionary patriotism&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Timothy spluttered. Being an Irish gentleman, he hated to be accused
      of patriotism, which he held&mdash;following Dr. Johnson&mdash;to be the
      last refuge of a scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing patriotic about it," he said. "What I object to hasn't
      anything to do with any particular country. It's simply a direct insult to
      the sun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun," said Mr. Courtney, smiling more offensively than ever, "can
      take care of itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can," said Sir Timothy, "and does. It takes jolly good care not to
      rise in Dublin at the same time that it does in Greenwich, and what you're
      trying to do is to bluff it into saying it does. When you come to think of
      it, the sun doesn't rise here the same time it does in Dublin. We're a
      hundred and twenty miles west of Dublin, so the real time here&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can't have a different time in every parish," said Mr. Courtney. "In
      the interests of international civilization&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care a row of pins about international civilization. We're
      something like twenty minutes wrong already here. When you've made your
      silly change to summer time, and wiped out that twenty-five minutes Irish
      time, we shall be an hour and three quarters wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events," said Mr. Courtney, "you'll have to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when you've got accustomed to it, you'll see the advantages of the
      change."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Timothy was profoundly irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may do as you like," he said, "I mean to stick to the proper time.
      The proper time, mind you, strictly according to the sun, as it rises in
      this neighbourhood. I haven't worked it out exactly yet, but I should say,
      roughly, that there'll be two hours' difference between your watch and
      mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Courtney gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say that you're actually going to add on two hours?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to take off two hours," said Sir Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Courtney thought for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be adding on those two hours," he said, "not taking them off&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're an extraordinarily muddle-headed man, Courtney. Can't you see that
      if I call it six when you say it's eight I'm taking off&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not. The way to look at it is this: A day is twenty-four hours
      long. You say it's twenty-six hours. Therefore, you add on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't do anything of the sort," said Sir Timothy. "Look here, the sun
      rises, say, at 6 a.m. You and a lot of other silly people choose to say
      that it rises at 8. What I'm doing&mdash;I and the sun, Courtney&mdash;mind
      that. The sun's with me&mdash;&mdash; What we're doing is taking off two
      hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument went on for some time. Its result was that Sir Timothy and
      Mr. Courtney did not speak to each other again for a fortnight Arguments,
      religious, political and economic, often end in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that fortnight summer time established itself, more or less, in the
      neighbourhood. Mr. Courtney, the local bank, the railway company, and the
      police observed the new time in its full intensity. The parish priest and
      most of the farmers took a moderate line. They sacrificed the twenty-five
      minutes of the original Irish time, but resisted the imposition of a whole
      extra hour. With them it was eight o'clock when the nine o'clock train
      started for Dublin. A few extremists stood out for their full rights as
      Irishmen, and insisted that the bank, which said it opened at 10 a.m., was
      really beginning business at 8.35 a.m. Sir Timothy, dragging his household
      with him, set up what he called actual time, and breakfasted a full two
      hours after the progressive party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practical inconvenience of these differences of opinion became obvious
      when Sir Timothy arrived at the Petty Sessions Court to take his seat on
      the Bench just as Mr. Courtney, having completed the business of the day,
      was going home for a rather late luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No cases to-day?" said Sir Timothy, coldly polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, there were, several. I've finished them off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Sir Timothy, "it's only just the hour for beginning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, it's 2 p.m."
    </p>
    <p>
      "12 noon," said Sir Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "2 p.m.," repeated Mr. Courtney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Timothy took out his watch. The hands were together at the hour of 12.
      He showed it to Mr. Courtney, who grimed. Sir Timothy scowled at him and
      turned fiercely to a police sergeant who stood by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergeant," he said, "what time is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not the function of the Irish police to decide great questions of
      State. Their business is to enforce what the higher powers, for the time
      being, wish the law to be. In case of any uncertainty about which power is
      the higher, the police occupy the uncomfortable position of neutrals. The
      sergeant was not quite sure whether Sir Timothy or Mr. Courtney were the
      more influential man. He answered cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's some," he said, "who do be saying that it's one o'clock at the
      present time. There's others&mdash;and I'm not saying they're wrong&mdash;who
      are of opinion that it's half-past twelve, or about that. There's them&mdash;and
      some of the most respectable people is with them there&mdash;that says
      it's 2 p.m. If I was to be put on my oath this minute, I'd find it mortal
      hard to say what time it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Act of Parliament," said Mr. Courtney, its 2 p.m.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the matter of an Act of Parliament," said the sergeant, "I wouldn't
      like to be contradicting your honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Timothy turned on his heel and walked away. The victory was with Mr.
      Courtney, but not because he had an Act of Parliament behind him. Nobody
      in Ireland pays much attention to Acts of Parliament. He made his point
      successfully, because the police did not like to contradict him. From that
      day on Sir Timothy made no attempt to take his seat on the Magistrates'
      Bench in the Court House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the summer Sir Archibald Chesney visited the neighbourhood. Sir
      Archibald is, of course, a great man. He is one of the people who are
      supposed to govern Ireland. He does not actually do so. Nobody could. But
      he dispenses patronage, which, after all, is one of the most important
      functions of any Government. It was, for instance, in Sir Archibald's
      power to give Mr. Courtney a pleasant and well-paid post in Dublin, to
      remove him from the uncongenial atmosphere of Connaught, and set him in an
      office in the Lower Castle Yard. There, and in a house in Ailesbury Road&mdash;houses
      in Ailesbury Road are most desirable&mdash;Mr. Courtney could mingle in
      really intellectual society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Courtney knew this, and invited Sir Archibald to be his guest during
      his stay in the neighbourhood. Sir Archibald gracefully accepted the
      invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a surprising thing happened. Mr. Courtney received a very friendly
      letter from Sir Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear," so the letter ran, "that Sir Archibald Chesney is to be with you
      for a few days next week. We shall be very pleased if you will bring him
      out to dine with us some evening. Shall we say Tuesday at 7.30? I shall
      not ask anyone else. Three of us will be enough for a couple of bottles of
      my old port."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Timothy's port was very old and remarkably good. Mr. Courtney had
      tasted it once or twice before the days when summer time was thought of.
      No doubt, Sir Archibald would appreciate the port.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might afterwards take an optimistic view of life, and feel well
      disposed towards Mr. Courtney. The invitation was accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Archibald and Mr. Courtney dressed for dinner, as gentlemen belonging
      to the high official classes in Ireland should and do. They put on shirts
      with stiff fronts and cuffs. With painful efforts they drove studs through
      tightly sealed buttonholes. They fastened white ties round their collars.
      They encased their stomachs in stiff white waistcoats. They struggled into
      silk-lined, silk-faced, long-tailed coats. They wrapped their necks in
      white silk scarves. They even put high silk hats on their heads. Their
      overcoats were becomingly open, for the day was warm. They took their
      seats in the motor. Every policeman in the village saluted them as they
      passed. They sped up the long, tree-lined avenue which led to Sir
      Timothy's house. They reached the lofty doorway, over which crouched lions
      upheld a shield, bearing a coat of arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the lawn opposite the door Sir Timothy, his two daughters and a young
      man whom Mr. Courtney recognized as the police inspector, were playing
      tennis. It was a bright and agreeable scene. The sun shone pleasantly. Sir
      Timothy and the police inspector were in white flannels. The girls wore
      pretty cotton frocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Archibald looked at Mr. Courtney.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've come the wrong day," he said, "or the wrong hour, or something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It <i>is</i> Tuesday," said Mr. Courtney, "and he certainly said 7.30."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's infernally awkward," said Sir Archibald, glancing at his clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Timothy crossed the lawn, swinging his tennis racket and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delighted to see you," he said. "I'd have asked you to come up for a game
      of tennis if I'd thought you'd have cared for it. Had an idea you'd be
      busy all day, and would rather dress at your own place. Hullo, you are
      dressed! A bit early, isn't it? But I'm delighted to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Archibald stepped slowly from the car. Men who undertake the task of
      governing Ireland must expect to find themselves looking like fools
      occasionally. But it is doubtful whether any turn of the political or
      administrative machine can make a man look as foolish as he feels when,
      elaborately dressed in evening clothes, he is suddenly set down on a sunny
      lawn in the middle of a group of people suitably attired for tennis. Sir
      Archibald, puzzled and annoyed, turned to Mr. Courtney with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said half-past seven," said Mr. Courtney.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm delighted to see you now or at any time, but, as a matter of fact,
      it's only half-past five," said Sir Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Archibald looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's&mdash;surely my watch can't have gained two hours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's half-past seven," said Mr. Courtney, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no it isn't," said Sir Timothy. "I don't dine by Act of Parliament."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Archibald frowned angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'd better go home again," he said. "We mustn't interrupt the tennis."
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed stiffly into the motor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose," he said to Mr. Courtney a few minutes later, "that this is
      some kind of Irish joke."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Courtney explained, elaborately and fully, Sir Timothy's peculiar
      views about time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I'd known," said Sir Archibald, "that you were taking me to dine with
      a lunatic, I should not have agreed to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Courtney recognized that his chances of promotion to a pleasant post
      in Dublin had vanished. The Irish Government had no use for men who place
      their superiors in embarrassing positions.

    <h2>
      XII ~~ UNITED IRELAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I'll say this for old MacManaway, an honester man never lived nor what he
      was; and I'm sorry he's gone, so I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was Dan Gallaher. The occasion was the morning of the auction
      of old MacManaway's property. The place was the yard behind the farmhouse
      in which MacManaway had lived, a solitary man, without wife or child, for
      fifty years. Dan Gallaher held the hames of a set of harness in his hand
      as he spoke and critically examined the leather of the traces. It was good
      leather, sound and well preserved. Old MacManaway while alive liked sound
      things and took good care of his property.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An honester man never lived," Dan repeated "And I'm not saying that
      because the old man and me agreed together, for we didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could you agree?" said James McNiece. "It wasn't to be expected that
      you would agree. There wasn't a stronger Protestant nor a greater
      Orangeman in the whole country nor old MacManaway."
    </p>
    <p>
      James McNiece turned from the examination of a cart as he spoke and gave
      his attention to the hames. His description of the dead man's religious
      and political convictions was just. No one in all the Ulster border land
      ever held the principle of the Orange Society more firmly or opposed any
      form of Home Rule more bitterly than old MacManaway.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dan Gallaher was a Roman Catholic and a Nationalist of the extremest
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They tell me," said Dan Gallaher, in a pleasant conversational tone,
      "that it's to be yourself, James McNiece, that's to be the head of the
      Orangemen in the parish now that MacManaway is gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      James looked at him sideways out of the corners of his eyes. Dan spoke in
      a friendly tone, but it is never wise to give any information to "Papishes
      and rebels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Colonel," he said, "is the Grand Master of the Orangemen in these
      parts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Eden, a J.P., and the principal landlord in the parish, drove into
      the yard in his motor. A police sergeant slipped his pipe into his pocket,
      stepped forward and took the number of the Colonel's car. It has never
      been decided in Ireland whether motor cars may or may not be used, under
      the provisions of D.O.R.A., for attending auctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that the safety of the empire is compromised by driving to a race
      meeting. We know that the King and his Army are in no way injured by our
      driving to market. Attendance at an auction stands midway between pleasure
      and business; and the use of motors in such matters is debatable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the D.I's orders, sir," said the sergeant apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said the Colonel, "but if the D.I. expects me to fine myself
      at the next Petty Sessions hell be disappointed."
    </p>
    <p>
      James McNiece and Dan Gallaher touched their hats to the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, James," said the Colonel. "Morning, Dan. Fine day for the sale,
      and a good gathering of people. I don't know that I ever saw a bigger
      crowd at an auction."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round as he spoke. The whole parish and many people from outside
      the parish had assembled. The yard was full of men, handling and
      appraising the outdoor effects. Women passed in and out of the house,
      poked mattresses with their fingers, felt the fabrics of sheets and
      curtains, examined china and kitchen utensils warily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's the doctor over there," said the Colonel, "looking at the stable
      buckets, and who's that young fellow in the yellow leggings, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not rightly sure," said James McNiece, "but I'm thinking he'll be the
      new D.I. from Curraghfin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is him," said Dan Gallaher. "I was asking the sergeant this minute and
      he told me. What's more he said he was a terrible sharp young fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That won't suit you, Dan," said the Colonel. "You and your friends will
      have to be a bit careful before you get up another rebellion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may not suit me," said Dan, "but there's others it won't suit either.
      Didn't I see the sergeant taking the number of your motor, Colonel, and
      would he be doing the like of that if the new D.I. hadn't told him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel laughed. As commander of a battalion of the Ulster Volunteer
      Force, he was fully prepared to meet Dan Gallaher on the field of battle&mdash;Dan
      leading the National Volunteers. He looked forward with something like
      pleasure to the final settlement of the Home Rule question by the ordeal
      of battle. In the meanwhile he and Dan Gallaher by no means hated each
      other, and were occasionally in full sympathy when the police or some
      ridiculous Government department made trouble by fussy activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robinson, the auctioneer, drove up in his dogcart. He touched his hat
      to Colonel Eden, gave an order to his clerk and crossed the yard briskly.
      He twisted the cigarette he smoked into the corner of his mouth with deft
      movements of his lips, waved his hand to various acquaintances and looked
      round him with quick, cheerful glances. No man in the country was quicker
      to appreciate the financial worth of a crowd. He knew before a single bid
      was made whether people were in a mood to spend lavishly. He found himself
      very well satisfied with the prospect of this particular auction. The
      stuff he had to sell, indoors and out, was good. The farmers were enjoying
      a prosperous season. They had money in their pockets which they would
      certainly want to spend. Mr. Robinson had visions of a percentage, his
      share of the proceeds, running into three figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began work in a corner of the yard with a cross-cut saw. The bidding
      rose merrily to a point slightly higher than the cost of a similar saw new
      in a shop. At 23/6 Mr. Robinson knocked it down to a purchaser who seemed
      well satisfied. A number of small articles, scythes, barrows, spades, were
      sold rapidly, Mr. Robinson moving round the yard from outhouse to
      outhouse, surrounded by an eager crowd which pressed on him. His progress
      was not unlike that of a queen bee at swarming time. He made&mdash;as she
      makes&mdash;short flights, and always at the end of them found himself in
      the centre of a cluster of followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about half-past twelve Mr. Robinson reached his most important lot. He
      lit a fresh cigarette&mdash;his eighth&mdash;before putting up for sale a
      rick of hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About four tons," said Mr. Robinson, "new meadow hay, well saved, saved
      with not a drop of rain. Gentlemen, I needn't tell you that this is a
      rare, under existing conditions, a unique opportunity. Hay&mdash;you know
      this better than I do&mdash;is at present unobtainable in the ordinary
      market Now, don't disappoint me, gentlemen. Let me have a reasonable
      offer. Thirty pounds. Did I hear some one say fifteen pounds? Less than
      four pounds a ton! Now, gentlemen, really&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the crowd in front of Mr. Robinson knew just as well as he did that
      four pounds a ton is not a reasonable offer. The bids succeeded each other
      rapidly. The original fifteen pounds changed to twenty pounds, then to
      twenty-five, rose a little more slowly to thirty pounds. At thirty-two
      pounds the bidding hesitated. Mr. Robinson, dropping his cigarette from
      his mouth, urged his clients on with gusts of eloquence. There was a short
      spurt The bids rose by five shillings at a time and finally stopped dead
      at thirty-four pounds. The hay was sold at a little over eight pounds a
      ton. Public interest, roused to boiling point by the sale of a whole rick
      of hay, cooled down a little when Mr. Robinson went on to the next lot on
      his list.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen," he said, "I am now offering the hay stored in the loft above
      the stable. A small lot, gentlemen, but prime hay. I offer no guarantee as
      to the quantity in the loft; but I should guess it at anything between ten
      and fifteen hundred-weight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of the more important farmers drew out of the crowd which
      surrounded Mr. Robinson. It was not worth while bidding for so small a
      quantity of hay. Other members of the crowd, feeling that a breathing
      space had been granted them, took packets of sandwiches from their pockets
      and sat down in one of the outhouses to refresh themselves. Mr. Robinson
      viewed the diminishing group of bidders with some disappointment. He was
      gratified to see that the new police officer from Curraghfin, a gentleman
      who had not so far made a single bid, crossed the yard and took a place on
      the steps leading to the loft. Colonel Eden, too, appeared interested in
      the new lot of hay. If the inspector of police and Colonel Eden began to
      bid against each other the hay might realize a good price.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, gentlemen," said Mr. Robinson, "shall we make a start with three pounds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Colonel Eden, then at the police officer. Neither gentleman
      made any sign of wishing to bid. It was James McNiece who made the first
      offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two pounds," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two pounds," said Mr. Robinson, "two pounds. Going at two pounds. You're
      not going to let this hay,&mdash;more than half a ton of it&mdash;go at
      two pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked appealingly at Colonel Eden and at the police officer. They were
      entirely unresponsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And at two pounds, going&mdash;&mdash;" said Mr. Robinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two-ten," said Dan Gallaher, in a quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two-fifteen," said James McNiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan Gallaher, still apparently bored by the proceedings, raised the price
      another five shillings. James McNiece went half a crown further. Dan
      Gallaher, becoming slightly interested, made a jump to three pounds ten.
      McNiece, with an air of finality, bid four pounds. The contest began to
      attract attention. When the price rose to five pounds interest became
      lively, and those who had drawn out of the group round Mr. Robinson began
      to dribble back. It seemed likely that the contest was one of those, not
      uncommon at Irish auctions, into which personal feelings enter largely and
      the actual value of the article sold is little considered. There was a
      certain piquancy about a struggle of this kind between a prominent
      Orangeman like James McNiece, and Dan Gallaher, whom everyone knew to be
      the leader of the Sinn Fein party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interest developed into actual excitement when the price rose to ten
      pounds. A half ton of hay never is and never has been worth ten pounds.
      But ten pounds was by no means the final bid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. McNiece," said Mr. Robinson, "the bid is against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guineas," said McNiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eleven," said Dan Gallaher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guineas," said McNiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duet went on, McNiece capping Gallaher's pounds with a monotonous
      repetition of the word guineas until the price rose to twenty pounds. At
      that point McNiece faltered for a moment. The auctioneer, watching keenly,
      saw him turn half round and look at Colonel Eden. The Colonel nodded
      slightly, so slightly that no one except Mr. Robinson and McNiece himself
      saw the gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At twenty pounds," said Mr. Robinson, "going, and at twenty pounds&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirty," said McNiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd of watchers gasped audibly. This was something outside of all
      experience. A man might willingly pay a few shillings, even a pound, too
      much for the sake of getting the better of an opponent; but to give thirty
      pounds for half a ton of hay&mdash;not even the natural enmity of an
      Orangeman for a Sinn Feiner would account for such recklessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guineas," said Dan Gallaher.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his turn to say guineas now, and he repeated the word without
      faltering until the price rose to fifty pounds. Mr. Robinson took off his
      hat and wiped the sweat from his forehead. Never in all his experience of
      auctions had he heard bidding like this. He lit a fresh cigarette, holding
      the match in fingers which trembled visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will understand, gentlemen, that I am only selling the hay, not the
      barn or the stable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guineas," said Dan Gallaher.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the last bid. As he made it Colonel Eden turned and walked out of
      the group round the auctioneer. James McNiece took his pipe from his
      pocket and filled it slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hay is yours, Mr. Gallaher," said the auctioneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan Gallaher, having secured the hay, left the yard. He found his horse,
      which he had tethered to a tree, and mounted. He rode slowly down the
      rough lane which led from the farm. At the gate leading to the high road
      the police sergeant stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you wouldn't mind waiting a minute, Mr. Gallaher," said the sergeant,
      "the D.I. would like to speak to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about?" said Gallaher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant winked ponderously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might be," he said, "about the hay you're just after buying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he wants it," said Gallaher, "he can have it, and I'll deliver it to
      him at his own home at half the price I paid for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The District Inspector, smiling and tapping his gaiters with a riding
      switch, explained in a few words that he did not want the hay and did not
      intend to pay for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm taking over the contents of that loft," he said, "in the name of the
      Government under the provisions of D.O.R.A."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said Gallaher, "that you've any right to be taking over
      what I've bought in that kind of way, and what's more you'll not be able
      to do it without you show me a proper order in writing, signed by a
      magistrate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were you," said the D.I., "I wouldn't insist on any kind of legal
      trial about that hay. At present there's no evidence against you, Mr.
      Gallaher, except that you paid a perfectly absurd price for some hay that
      you didn't want, and I'm not inclined to press the matter now I've got
      what I wanted; but if you insist on dragging the matter into Court&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not," said Gallaher.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock that evening Dan Gallaher and James McNiece sat together in
      the private room behind the bar of Sam Twining's public-house. The house
      was neutral ground used by Orangemen and Nationalists alike, a convenient
      arrangement, indeed a necessary arrangement, for there was no other
      public-house nearer than Curraghfin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dan," said James McNiece, "I'm an Orangeman and a Protestant and a
      loyalist, and what I've always said about Home Rule and always will say is
      this:&mdash;We'll not have it and to Hell with the rebels. But I'm telling
      you now I'd rather you had them, papist and rebel and all as you are, than
      see them swept off that way by the police. And what's more, I'm not the
      only one says that. The Colonel was talking to me after he heard what
      happened, and what he said was this&mdash;'The Government of this
      country,' said he, meaning the police, 'is a disgrace to civilization.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me your hand, James McNiece," said Gallaher. "Let me shake your hand
      to show there's no ill feeling about the way I bid against you at the sale
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      McNiece laid down the glass of whisky which he was raising to his lips and
      stretched out his hand. Gallaher grasped it and held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me this now, James McNiece," he said, "for it's what I was never
      sure of&mdash;How many was there behind that hay?"

      McNiece looked round him carefully and made sure that no third person
      could hear him. Neglecting no precaution he sank his voice to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty rifles," he said, "of the latest pattern, the same as the soldiers
      use, and four hundred rounds of ball cartridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh," said Gallaher, "but we'd have done great work with them. Either
      your lads or mine, James McNiece, would have done great work with them.
      But, sure, what's the use of talking? The police has them now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn the police," said James McNiece.

    <h2>
      XIII ~~ OLD BIDDY AND THE REBELS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The other servants&mdash;there were four of them&mdash;spoke of her as
      "the ould cat" or in moments of extreme exasperation "that divil Biddy
      O'Halloran." When they spoke to her they called her "Mrs. O'Halloran," or
      even "Mrs. O'Halloran, ma'am." Even Lady Devereux, though nominal mistress
      of the house, did not dare to call her "Biddy," She would as soon have
      addressed an archbishop as "Dickie," if, indeed, there is an arch-bishop
      whose Christian name is Richard. There is probably not a woman anywhere,
      however brave, who would venture to speak to Mrs. O'Halloran face to face
      and call her "Biddy." But a man, especially if he be young and
      good-looking, is in a different case. Harry Devereux called her "Biddy."
      He had earned the right to be familiar with his aunt's cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a schoolboy Harry spent most of his holidays at his aunt's house in
      Dublin, and in those days Mrs. O'Halloran used to box his ears and
      occasionally spank him. When he grew to be a man and was called in due
      course to the Irish Bar, he was often at his aunt's house and still
      visited Mrs. O'Halloran in her kitchen. She gave up smacking him but she
      still called him "Master Harry," After the outbreak of war Harry Devereux
      became a Second Lieutenant in the Wessex Regiment. He displayed himself in
      his uniform to his aunt, who admired his appearance in her placid way. He
      also showed himself to Mrs. O'Halloran, who snubbed him sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it's fighting you're for now, Master Harry," she said. "Well, it's
      what'll suit you. It's my opinion that you're never out of mischief only
      when you're in something worse. It is that way with you as long as I know
      you and that's since you were born or pretty near. It's the Germans, is
      it? Well, I'm sorry for them Germans if there's many like you going to be
      soldiers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry took this as a compliment It was his hope that the Germans would be
      sorry for themselves when he got out to France with his platoon of Wessex
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner. Molly, the parlourmaid, her day's work ended, became
      sentimental. She said it was a terrible thing to think of all the fine men
      that would be killed, and maybe young Mr. Devereux among them. Mrs.
      O'Halloran checked her flow of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it Master Harry be killed? Talk sense, can't you? Sure you couldn't
      kill the like of that one. Haven't I seen him, not once but a dozen times,
      climbing out on the roof of the house and playing himself to and fro among
      the chimneys. If that wasn't the death of him, and him not more than
      twelve years old at the time, is it likely the Germans would be able to
      kill him? The like of him is the same as fleas that you'd be squeezing
      with your finger and thumb or maybe drowning in a basin of water. You know
      well they'd be hopping over you after the same as before."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly sniffed. It was not wise to argue with "Ould Biddy," who had a
      talent for forcible speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Halloran had the best right in the world to the free use of her
      tongue. She was a really good cook. She had satisfied Sir Joseph Devereux
      while he lived. She satisfied Lady Devereux afterwards. And Lady Devereux
      appreciated good cooking. Her husband dead, her three daughters safely
      married, she had leisure to enjoy eating and had money enough to pay for
      the best which the Dublin markets provided. Next to good food Lady
      Devereux valued peace and the absence of worry. Mrs. O'Halloran enjoyed
      strife and liked a strenuous life. She took all the annoyances of the
      household on herself, and when they proved too few for her, created
      unnecessary worry for herself by harassing the maids. Lady Devereux slept
      untroubled at night, rose late in the morning, found all things very much
      to her liking, and grew comfortably fat.
    </p>
    <p>
      For eight months of the year, from October till the end of May, Lady
      Devereux lived in one of the fine Georgian houses which are the glory of
      the residential squares of Dublin. It was a corner house, rather larger
      than the others in the square, with more light and more air, because its
      position gave it a view up and down two streets as well as across the lawn
      which formed the centre of the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the war Harry Devereux used to say that his aunt's house was the
      best in Dublin for a dance. It pained him to see its possibilities wasted.
      After receiving his commission he looked at the world with the eye of a
      soldier and gave it as his opinion that the house occupied the finest
      strategic position in Dublin. There was not much chance of persuade ing
      plump old Lady Devereux to give a ball. There seemed even less chance of
      her home ever being used as a fortress. But fate plays strange tricks with
      us and our property, especially in Ireland. It happened that Lady
      Devereux' house was occupied more or less by the soldiers of one army, and
      shot at with some vigour by the soldiers of another on Easter Monday,
      1916. Oddly enough it was neither the rebels nor the soldiers who earned
      credit by their military operations, but old Biddy O'Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Halloran always enjoyed Bank holidays greatly. She did not go out,
      visit picture houses or parade the streets in her best clothes. She found
      a deeper and more satisfying pleasure in telling the younger maids what
      she thought of them when they asked and obtained leave to go out for the
      afternoon, and in making scathing remarks about their frocks and hats as
      they passed through the kitchen to reach the area door. On that particular
      Easter Monday she was enjoying herself thoroughly. A kitchenmaid&mdash;she
      was new to the household or she would not have done it&mdash;had asked
      Lady Devereux' permission to go out for the afternoon and evening. She got
      what she asked for. Everybody who asked Lady Devereux for anything got it
      as a matter of course. The kitchenmaid ought to have made her application
      through Mrs. O'Halloran. It is the rule in all services that remote
      authorities must be approached only through the applicant's immediate
      superiors. Mrs. O'Halloran took her own way of impressing this on the
      kitchenmaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose now," she said, "that you'll be trapsing the streets of Dublin
      in the new pink blouse that you spent your last month's wages on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was exactly what the kitchenmaid meant to do. Mrs. O'Halloran looked
      the girl over critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," she said, "that I ever seen a girl that would look worse
      in a pink blouse than yourself. The face that's on you is the colour of a
      dish of mashed turnips, and the pink blouse will make it worse, if worse
      can be."
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchenmaid was a girl of some spirit She felt inclined to cry, but
      she pulled herself together and snorted instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose," said Mrs. O'Halloran, "that you'll be looking out for a young
      man to keep you company?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchenmaid did, in fact, hope to walk about with a young man; but she
      denied this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be looking for no such thing," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's well for you then," said Mrs. O'Halloran, "for I'm thinking you'd
      look a long while before you found one. It's very little sense men has,
      the best of them, but I never met one yet that hadn't more sense than to
      go after a girl like you. If you were any good for any mortal thing a man
      might be content to marry you in spite of your face; but the way you are,
      not fit to darn your own stockings, let alone sew for a man, or cook the
      way he could eat what you put before him, it would be a queer one that
      would walk the same side of the street with you, pink blouse or no pink
      blouse."
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchenmaid, though a girl of spirit, was still young. She was washing
      potatoes in the scullery while Mrs. O'Halloran spoke to her. Two large
      tears dropped from her eyes into the sink. Mrs. O'Halloran smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Molly, the parlourmaid, flung open the kitchen door and rushed to
      Mrs. O'Halloran. Her face was flushed with excitement and terror. Her eyes
      were staring. She was panting. Her nice frilly cap was over one ear. She
      held her apron crumpled into a ball and clutched tightly in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's murdered we'll be, killed and murdered and worse! There's them in
      the house with guns and all sorts that'll ruin and destroy everything
      that's in it The mistress is dead this minute and it's me they're after
      now. What'll we do at all, at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchenmaid, stirred from her private grief by the news, left her
      potatoes and came to the kitchen. She and Molly clung to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the Sinn Feiners," she said, "and they're out for blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the police?" said Molly. "What good is the police that they
      wouldn't be here and us being murdered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's blood they want," said the kitchenmaid, "and if s blood they'll
      have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly," said Mrs. O'Halloran, "is there men in the house or is there not?
      Stop your bawling now, and tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is, there is," said Molly, "with guns and cannons and knives. Glory
      be to God, but I never thought to die this way. What'll we do at all, at
      all? Would it be any good hiding?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Halloran, with cool deliberation, shifted the position of two pots
      on the kitchen range. Then she wiped her hands on her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's your place to attend the door and not mine, Molly," she said, "but
      if you're afeard...."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked scornfully at the two girls and left the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall a young man stood just inside the door on the mat. He wore a
      greenish-grey uniform and carried a rifle. Across his chest was a
      bandolier. He looked uncomfortable, like a man who finds himself
      unexpectedly in a public place when wearing a fancy dress. The door was
      wide open. On the steps outside were two other young men. They also wore
      uniforms and carried rifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now what may you be wanting?" said Mrs. O'Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man on the mat&mdash;he was really little more than a boy&mdash;fumbled
      in one pocket after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      His uniform, like that of the British soldier, had a good many pockets.
      Finally he drew out a sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is my authority," he said, "from the Provisional Government of the
      Irish Republic."
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed the paper to Mrs. O'Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it's a collection you're making for the Irish Language Fund," said
      Mrs. O'Halloran, "her ladyship gave half a crown last week to one of yees,
      and she'll give no more, so you can take yourselves off out of this as
      quick as you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are not collectors," said the young man, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whether you are not, it's what you look," said Mrs. O'Halloran, "dressed
      up in them clothes, with your toy guns and all. You ought to be ashamed of
      yourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion that his rifle was not a real weapon roused the spirit of
      the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the name of the Irish Republic," he said, "I take possession of this
      house for military purposes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Musha, but that's fine talk," said Mrs. O'Halloran. "Will nothing do you,
      only military purposes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall do no harm to the inmates or the contents of the house," said
      the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not, for you won't be let."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I demand free entrance to the upper storeys for myself and my men."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the two boys on the steps outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enter," he said, "and follow me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you wipe your boots on the mat," said Mrs. O'Halloran, "and not be
      carrying all the mud of the streets into the house with you. Do you think
      the girls that does be here has nothing to do only to be sweeping carpets
      and polishing floors after the likes of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The army of the Irish Republic has had many crimes laid to its charge; but
      it has not been said that its soldiers were guilty of any needless
      discourtesy to the inhabitants of the houses of which they took
      possession. The three young men wiped their boots on Lady Devereux'
      doormat with elaborate cafe. Mrs. O'Halloran watched them critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it the police you're out after with them guns?" she said. "It's a
      pity, so it is, to see fine young fellows like you mixing yourselves up
      with that foolishness. Sure they'll get you at the latter end, and you'll
      be had up in Court."
    </p>
    <p>
      The leader of the little party of Sinn Feiners was not inclined to discuss
      the future prospects of the insurrection with Mrs. O'Halloran. He moved
      across the hall towards the staircase, followed by his two young men. They
      walked delicately, stepping carefully from one to another of the rugs
      which lay on the floor and avoiding the polished boards. They were
      courteous and considerate rebels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will nothing but the front stairs suit you?" said Mrs. O'Halloran. "Cock
      you up, indeed, the likes of you, that never was in a lady's house before.
      The back stairs is good enough for me, so I'm thinking it's good enough
      for you. Come along with you now."
    </p>
    <p>
      She led them past the foot of the great staircase and through a swing door
      covered with green baize. That door, such was the fancy of the designer of
      Lady Devereux' house, concealed another, a very solid door, made after the
      Georgian fashion, of thick mahogany. The baize-covered door had a spring
      on it so that it swung shut of itself. Mrs. O'Halloran held it open with
      one hand. With the other she turned the handle of the solid door beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come along now," she said to the three young men, "and take care
      you don't be scratching the polish off the door with them guns you're so
      proud of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They were foolish rebels, those three. They were young and, though Irish,
      this was the first time they had taken part in an insurrection. They had
      marched forth to garrison Lady Devereux' house expecting much,
      hand-to-hand fighting perhaps in the hall, the tears and hysterics of
      terrified women, revolver shots from outraged loyalists. Anything of that
      sort, anything heroic they were prepared for. Old Biddy O'Halloran, with
      her humorous eyes and her ready tongue, took them aback. They walked
      through the mahogany door meekly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found themselves in a small cloak room. There was a wash-hand basin
      and a couple of towels in one corner. A pile of carriage rugs lay on a
      shelf. Some waterproof coats hung from pegs. There were three umbrellas in
      a stand. There was one small window which looked out on a back yard and
      was heavily barred. There was not the smallest sign of a staircase leading
      to the upper storey of the house or to anywhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nervous and excitable woman who had trapped three young men would have
      made haste to lock them in. Mrs. O'Halloran was in no hurry at all. The
      key of the mahogany door was on the inside of the lock. She took it out
      deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you stay," she said, "the three of yous, till you've sense enough
      to go back to your homes, and it's your mothers will be thankful to me
      this day for keeping you out of mischief. Listen to me now before I lock
      the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      She fitted the key into the outside of the lock and half closed the door
      while she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I hear a word out of your heads or if there's any shooting of them
      guns, or if you start cracking and banging on that door, or kicking up any
      sort of a noise that might disturb her ladyship, I'll give you neither
      bite nor sup, not if I have to keep you here for a week, so be good now
      and mind what I'm telling you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut the door and turned the key in the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the kitchen stairs stood Molly and the kitchenmaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will I run for the police?" said the kitchenmaid. "Sure I wouldn't be
      afeard to do it if Molly would come with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll run down to the scullery," said Mrs. O'Halloran, "and you'll go on
      washing them potatoes, and Molly along with you. That's all the running
      either the one or the other of you will do this day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her ladyship's bell is ringing," said Molly. "Will I not go to her? It
      could be she's not dead yet and might be wanting help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's little help you'd give her if she was wanting it, you with your cap
      on your ear, instead of the top of your head, and your apron like a wrung
      dishclout I wonder you're not ashamed to be seen. Get along with you down
      to the kitchen and stay there. Anything that's wanted for her ladyship
      I'll do myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Devereux was in her morning room, a pleasant sunny apartment which
      looked out on the square. The day was warm, but Lady Devereux was an old
      woman. She sat in front of a bright fire. She sat in a very deep soft
      chair with her feet on a footstool. She had a pile of papers and magazines
      on a little table beside her. She neither stirred nor looked up when Mrs.
      O'Halloran entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly," she said, "I heard some men talking in the hall. I wish they
      wouldn't make so much noise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Halloran cleared her throat and coughed. Lady Devereux looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," she said, "it's not Molly. It's you, Mrs. O'Halloran. Then I suppose
      it must be plumbers."
    </p>
    <p>
      The inference was a natural one. Mrs. O'Halloran always dealt with
      plumbers when they came. She was the only person in the house who could
      deal with plumbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or perhaps some men about the gas," said Lady Devereux. "I hope they
      won't want to come in here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleasant quiet life in Lady Devereux' house was occasionally broken by
      visits from plumbers and gas men. No one, however wealthy or easygoing,
      can altogether escape the evils which have grown up with our civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not plumbers, my lady," said Mrs. O'Halloran, "nor it isn't gas men.
      It's Sinn Feiners."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, I suppose they want a subscription. My purse is on my writing
      table, Mrs. O'Halloran. Will five shillings be enough? I think I ought to
      give them something. I'm always so sorry for people who have to go round
      from house to house collecting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the three of them in the cloakroom downstairs and the key turned
      on them," said Mrs. O'Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite possible that Lady Devereux might have expressed some surprise
      at this drastic way of treating men, presumably well-meaning men, who came
      to ask for money. Before she spoke again she was startled by the sound of
      several rifle shots fired in the street outside her house. She was not
      much startled, not at all alarmed. A rifle fired in the open air at some
      distance does not make a very terrifying sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me," she said, "I wonder what that is. It sounds very like somebody
      shooting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Halloran went over to the window and opened it. There was a narrow
      iron balcony outside. She stepped on to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's soldiers, my lady," she said. "They're in the square."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it must be on account of the war," said Lady Devereux.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had learned&mdash;before Easter, 1916, everybody had learned&mdash;to
      put down all irregularities to the war. Letters got lost in the post. The
      price of sugar rose. Men married unexpectedly, "on account of the war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't think they ought to be allowed to shoot in the square," she
      added. "It might be dangerous."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dangerous. A bullet&mdash;it must have passed very close to Mrs.
      O'Halloran&mdash;buried itself in the wall of the morning room. A moment
      later another pierced a mirror which hung over Lady Devereux' writing
      table. Mrs. O'Halloran came into the room again and shut the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd think now," she said "that them fellows were shooting at the
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you'd go down and tell them to stop," said Lady Devereux. "Of
      course I know we ought to do all we can to help the soldiers, such gallant
      fellows, suffering so much in this terrible war. Still I do think they
      ought to be more careful where they shoot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Halloran went quietly down the two flights of stairs which led from
      the morning-room to the ground floor of the house. She had no idea of
      allowing herself to be hustled into any undignified haste either by rebels
      or troops engaged in suppressing the rebellion. When she reached the
      bottom of the stairs she stopped. Her attention was held by two different
      noises. The Sinn Feiners were battering the door of their prison with the
      butts of their rifles. Molly, the kitchenmaid and Lady Devereux' two other
      servants were shrieking on the kitchen stairs. Mrs. O'Halloran dealt with
      the rebels first. She opened the baize-covered door and put her mouth to
      the keyhole of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will yous keep quiet or will yous not?" she said. "There's soldiers
      outside the house this minute waiting for the chance to shoot you, and
      they'll do it, too, if you don't sit down and behave yourselves. Maybe
      it's that you want. If it is you're going the right way about getting it.
      But if you've any notion of going home to your mothers with your skins
      whole you'll stay peaceable where you are. Can you not hear the guns?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The three rebels stopped battering the door and listened. The rifle fire
      began to slacken. No more than an occasional shot was to be heard. The
      fighting had died down. It was too late for the prisoners to take any
      active part in it. They began to consider the future. They made up their
      minds to take the advice given them and stay quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Halloran went to the head of the kitchen stairs. The four maids
      were huddled together. Mrs. O'Halloran descended on them. She took Molly,
      who was nearest to her, by the shoulders and shook her violently. The
      housemaid and Lady Devereux' maid fled at once to the coal cellar. The
      kitchenmaid sat down and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there's another sound out of any of yous," said Mrs. O'Halloran,
      "it'll be the worse for you after. Isn't it enough for one day to have
      three young fellows in the house trying to get shot, and soldiers outside
      trying to shoot them, and every sort of divilment in the way of a row
      going on, without having a pack of girls bellowing and bawling on the
      kitchen stairs? It's mighty fond you are, the whole of you, of dressing
      yourselves up, in pink blouses and the like" (she looked angrily at the
      kitchenmaid) "and running round the streets to see if you can find a man
      to take up with you. And now when there's men enough outside and in,
      nothing will do but to be screeching. But sure girls is like that, and
      where's the use of talking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Halloran might have said more. She felt inclined to say a good deal
      more but she was interrupted by a loud knocking at the hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dursent go to it." said Molly. "I dursent You wouldn't know who might
      be there nor what they might do to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody's asking you to go," said Mrs. O'Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the door herself and opened it. A sergeant and eight men were
      on the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what may you be wanting?" said Mrs. O'Halloran. "What right have you
      to come battering and banging at the door of her ladyship's house the same
      as if it was a public-house and you trying to get in after closing time?
      Be off out of this, now, the whole of you. I never seen such foolishness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My orders are to search the house," said the sergeant; "rebels have been
      firing on us from the roof."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no rebels been firing out of this house," said Mrs. O'Halloran,
      "and what's more&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My orders," said the sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no orders given in this house," said Mrs. O'Halloran, "only mine
      and maybe her ladyship's at odd times."
    </p>
    <p>
      She need scarcely have mentioned Lady Devereux. An order from her was a
      very exceptional thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our officer&mdash;&mdash;" said the sergeant "Private Beggs, go and
      report to the officer that we are refused admission to this house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Private Beggs turned to obey the order. The officer in charge of the party
      came out of the door of a house half-way along the side of the square.
      Mrs. O'Halloran recognised him. It was Second Lieutenant Harry Devereux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master Harry," she called, "Master Harry, come here at once. Is it you
      that's been raising ructions about the square? Shooting and destroying and
      frightening decent people into fits? Faith, I might have known it was you.
      If there's divilment going you'd be in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Devereux, intensely conscious of his responsibility as commander of
      men in a real fight, reached the bottom of the steps which led to his
      aunt's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enter the house, sergeant," he said, "and search it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Halloran stood right in the middle of the doorway. The sergeant
      looked at her doubtfully and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come up out of that, Master Harry," said Mrs. O'Halloran, "and don't be
      trying to hide behind the sergeant. It's no wonder you're ashamed of
      yourself, but I see you plain enough. Come here now till I talk to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant grinned. Private Beggs, who was behind his officer, laughed
      openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was there nowhere else in the world for you to have a battle&mdash;if a
      battle was what you wanted," said Mrs. O'Halloran, "only in front of your
      aunt's house? Many and many's the time I've smacked you for less than what
      you've done to-day. Isn't there bullets in her ladyship's morning-room?
      Isn't there a grand looking-glass in a gold frame gone to smithers with
      your shooting? Isn't Molly and the other girls screeching this minute down
      in the coal cellar, for fear you'll kill them, and now nothing will do you
      seemingly only to be tramping all over the house. Search it, moya, search
      it! But you'll not be let, Master Harry; neither you nor the sergeant nor
      any of the rest of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Second Lieutenant Harry Devereux pulled himself together and made an
      effort to save what was left of his dignity. He had led his men across the
      square under a shower of rebel bullets from the roofs of the houses. He
      had taken cool advantage of all possible cover. He had directed his men's
      fire till he drove the rebels from their shelters. No one could say of him
      that he was other than a gallant officer. But his heart failed him when he
      was face to face with his aunt's cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we needn't search this house, sergeant," he said. "I know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'd like to come back in an hour or two, Master Harry," said Mrs.
      O'Halloran, "I'll have a bit of dinner ready for you, and I wouldn't say
      but there might be something for the sergeant and his men. It's what her
      ladyship is always saying that we ought to do the best we can for the lads
      that's fighting for us against the Germans&mdash;so long as they behave
      themselves. But mind this now, sergeant, if you do look in in the course
      of the evening there must be no carrying on with the girls. The Lord knows
      they're giddy enough without you upsetting them worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, after dark, three young Sinn Feiners climbed the wall at the
      end of Lady Devereux' back yard and dropped into a narrow lane beyond it.
      A fortnight later Mrs. O'Halloran received a large parcel containing three
      suits of clothes, the property of Second Lieutenant Devereux, left by him
      in his aunt's house when he first put on his uniform. They were carefully
      brushed and folded, in no way the worse for having been worn by strangers
      for one night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bottom of Mrs. O'Halloran's trunk there are three rebel uniforms.
      And on the top of the cupboard in her room are three rifles, made in
      Germany.

      XIV ~~ CIVILIZED WAR
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "This," said Captain Power, "is an utterly rotten war."
    </h3>
    <p>
      The rain was dripping through the roof of the shed which had been allotted
      to Power as a billet The mud outside was more than ankle deep. The damp
      inside was chilly and penetrating. Ned Waterhouse, a Second Lieutenant,
      the only other occupant of the shed, looked up from an old newspaper which
      he was trying to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All wars are rotten," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said Power; "a properly conducted war, run in a decent way
      by civilized men is quite agreeable, rather fun, in fact. Now the last in
      which I was mixed up was rather fun."
    </p>
    <p>
      Waterhouse eyed Power suspiciously. He suspected that he was being made
      the victim of some kind of joke. Waterhouse was an Englishman and it was
      not of his own desire that he was an officer in the Hibernian light
      Infantry. He felt himself out of place among Irishmen whom he never quite
      understood. He was particularly distrustful of Captain Power. Power was an
      expert in the art of "pulling the legs" of innocent people. Waterhouse had
      several times found himself looking like a fool without knowing exactly
      why.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I call a civilized war," said Power, "is waged in fine weather for
      one thing, and men have a chance of keeping clean. The combatants show
      some regard for the other side's feelings and don't try to make things as
      nasty for each other as they can. The business is done in a picturesque
      way, with flags and drums and speeches. There are negotiations and flags
      of truce and mutual respect for gallant foemen&mdash;instead of this
      d____d coldblooded, scientific slaughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No war was ever like that," said Waterhouse. "Novelists and other silly
      fools write about war as if it were a kind of sport. But it never was
      really."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last war I was in, was," said Power.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe you ever were in a war before," said Waterhouse. "You're
      not old enough to have gone to South Africa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same I was in a war," said Power, "though I didn't actually
      fight. I was wounded at the time and couldn't But I was there. Our Irish
      war at Easter, 1916."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That footy little rebellion," said Waterhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may call it what you like," said Power, "but it was a much better war
      than this one from every point of view, except mere size. It was properly
      conducted on both sides."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you want to tell a yarn about it," said Waterhouse, "and if you
      do I can't stop you; but you needn't suppose I'll believe a word you say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The truth of this narrative," said Power, "will compel belief even in the
      most sceptical mind. I happened to be at home at the time on sick leave,
      wounded in the arm. Those were the days when one got months of sick leave,
      before some rotten ass invented convalescent homes for officers and kept
      them there. I had three months' leave that time and I spent it with my
      people in Ballymahon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole of it?" said Waterhouse. "Good Lord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd have spent it in the Strand Palace Hotel, I suppose, running in and
      out of music halls, but I prefer the simple joys of country life, though I
      couldn't shoot or ride properly on account of my arm. Still I could watch
      the sunset and listen to the birds singing, which I like. Besides, I was
      absolutely stoney at the time, and couldn't have stayed in London for a
      week. As it happened, it was a jolly good thing I was there. If I'd been
      in London I'd have missed that war. Perhaps I'd better begin by telling
      you the sort of place Ballymahon is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't," said Waterhouse. "I spent three months in camp in County
      Tipperary. I know those dirty little Irish towns. Twenty public-houses.
      Two churches, a workhouse and a police barrack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Ballymahon there is also a court house and our ancestral home. My old
      dad is the principal doctor in the neighbourhood. He lives on one side of
      the court house. The parish priest lives on the other. You must grasp
      these facts in order to understand the subsequent military operations. The
      only other thing you really must know is that Ballymahon lies in a hole
      with hills all round it, like the rim of a saucer. Well, on Monday
      afternoon, Easter Monday, the enemy, that is to say, the Sinn Feiners,
      marched in and took possession of the town. It was a most imposing sight,
      Waterhouse. There were at least eight hundred of them. Lots of them had
      uniforms. Most of them had flags. There were two bands and quite a lot of
      rifles. The cavalry&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't expect me to believe in the cavalry," said Waterhouse. ''But I
      say, supposing they really came, didn't the loyal inhabitants put up any
      kind of resistance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My old dad," said Power, "was the only loyal inhabitant, except four
      policemen. You couldn't expect four policemen to give battle to a whole
      army. They shut themselves up in their barrack and stayed there. My dad,
      being a doctor, was of course a non-combatant I couldn't do anything with
      my arm in a sling, so there was no fight at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose the next thing they did was loot the public-houses," said
      Waterhouse, "and get gloriously drunk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not I told you that our war was properly conducted. There was
      no looting in Ballymahon and I never saw a drunken man the whole time. If
      those Sinn Feiners had a fault it was over-respectability. I shouldn't
      care to be in that army myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe that," said Waterhouse. "It's the first thing in this story
      that I really have believed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They used to march about all day in the most orderly manner, and at night
      there were sentries at every street corner who challenged you in Irish.
      Not knowing the language, I thought it better to stay indoors. But my dad
      used to wander about He's a sporting old bird and likes to know what's
      going on. Well, that state of things lasted three days and we all began to
      settle down comfortably for the summer. Except that there were no
      newspapers or letters there wasn't much to complain about. In fact, you'd
      hardly have known there was a war on. It wasn't the least like this
      beastly country where everyone destroys everything he sees, and wretched
      devils have to live in rabbit-holes. In Ballymahon we lived in houses with
      beds and chairs and looked after ourselves properly. Then one morning&mdash;it
      must have been Friday&mdash;news came in that a lot of soldiers were
      marching on the town. Some country girls saw them and came running in to
      tell us. I must say for the Sinn Fein commander that he kept his head. His
      name was O'Farrelly and he called himself a Colonel. He sent out scouts to
      see where the soldiers were and how many there were. Quite the proper
      thing to do. I didn't hear exactly what the scouts reported; but that
      evening O'Farrelly came round to our house to talk things over with my
      dad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you said your father was a loyal man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he is. There isn't a loyaller man in Ireland. You'd know that if you'd
      ever seen him singing 'God Save the King.' He swells out an inch all over
      when he's doing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he's as loyal as all that," said Waterhouse, "he wouldn't consult with
      rebels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dad, though loyal, has some sense, and so, as it happened, had
      O'Farrelly. Neither one nor the other of them wanted to see a battle
      fought in the streets of Ballymahon. You've seen battles, Waterhouse, and
      you know what they're like. Messy things. You can understand my father's
      feelings. O'Farrelly was awfully nice about it. He said that the people of
      Ballymahon, including my father and even the police, were a decent lot,
      and he'd hate to see licentious English soldiers rioting through the
      streets of the town. His idea was that my dad should use his influence
      with the C.O. of the troops and get him to march his men off somewhere
      else, so as to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. O'Farrelly promised he
      wouldn't go after them or molest them in any way if they left the
      neighbourhood My dad said he couldn't do that and even if he could, he
      wouldn't. He suggested that O'Farrelly should take his army away.
      O'Farrelly said he was out to fight and not to run away. I chipped in at
      that point and said he could fight just as well in a lonelier place, where
      there weren't any houses and no damage would be done. I said I felt pretty
      sure the soldiers would go after him to any bog he chose to select
      O'Farrelly seemed to think there was something in the suggestion and said
      he'd hold a council of war and consult his officers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an amazing liar you are, Power," said Waterhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Power took no notice of the insult. He went on with his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Council of War assembled next morning," he said, "and sat for about
      four hours. It might have all day if an English officer hadn't ridden in
      on a motor-bike about noon. He was stopped by a sentry, of course, and
      said he wanted to see the C.O. of the rebel army. So the sentry
      blindfolded him&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In civilized war," said Power severely, "envoys with flags of truce are
      invariably blindfolded. I told you at the start that our war was properly
      conducted; but you wouldn't believe me. Now you can see for yourself that
      it was. The sentry led that officer into the council, which was sitting in
      the court house. I told you, didn't I, that the court house was the rebel
      H.Q.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't mention it, but it doesn't matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does matter. And you'll see later on it's most important Well,
      O'Farrelly was frightfully polite to the officer, and asked him what he
      wanted. The officer said that he had come to demand the unconditional
      surrender of the whole of the rebel army. O'Farrelly, still quite
      politely, said he'd rather die than surrender, and everybody present
      cheered. The officer said that the town was entirely surrounded and that
      there was a gun on top of one of the hills which would shell the place
      into little bits in an hour if it started firing. O'Farrelly said he
      didn't believe all that and accused the officer of putting up a bluff. The
      officer stuck to it that what he said was true. That brought the
      negotiations to a dead-lock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the devil didn't they shell the place and have done with it, instead
      of talking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what would happen out here," said Power. "But as I keep telling
      you our war was run on humane lines. After the officer and O'Farrelly had
      argued for half an hour my dad dropped in on them. He's a popular man in
      the place and I think everyone was glad to see him. He sized up the
      position at once and suggested the only possible way out O'Farrelly, with
      a proper safe conduct, of course, was to be allowed to go and see whether
      the town was really surrounded, and especially whether there was a gun on
      top of the hill, as the officer said. That, I think you'll agree with me,
      Waterhouse, was a sensible suggestion and fair to both sides. But they
      both boggled at it. The officer said he'd no power to enter into
      negotiation of any kind with rebels, and that all he could do was take yes
      or no to his proposal of unconditional surrender. O'Farrelly seemed to
      think that he'd be shot, no matter what safe conducts he had. It took the
      poor old dad nearly an hour to talk sense into the two of them; but in the
      end he managed it O'Farrelly agreed to go if the safe conduct was signed
      by my dad as well as the officer, and the officer agreed to take him on
      condition that my dad went too to explain the situation to his colonel. I
      went with them just to see what would happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose they made O'Farrelly prisoner?" said Waterhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are judging everybody by the standards of this infernal war," said
      Power. "That English colonel was a soldier and a gentleman. He stood us
      drinks and let O'Farrelly look at the gun. It was there all right and
      Ballymahon was entirely surrounded. We got back about five o'clock, with
      an ultimatum written out on a sheet of paper. Unless O'Farrelly and his
      whole army had marched out and laid down their arms by 8 p.m. the town
      would be shelled without further warning. You'd have thought that would
      have knocked the heart out of O'Farrelly, considering that he hadn't a
      dog's chance of breaking through. But it didn't He became cheerfuller than
      I'd seen him before, and said that the opportunity he'd always longed for
      had come at last. His men, when he told them about the ultimatum, took the
      same view. They said they'd never surrender, not even if the town was
      shelled into dust and them buried in the ruins. That naturally didn't suit
      my dad&mdash;or for that matter, me. The soldiers were sure to begin by
      shelling the rebel H.Q. and that meant that they'd hit our house. I told
      you, didn't I, that it was next door to the court house? My poor dad did
      his best. He talked to O'Farrelly and the rest of them till the sweat ran
      off him. But it wasn't the least bit of good. They simply wouldn't listen
      to reason. It was seven o'clock before dad gave the job up and left the
      court house. He was going home to make his will, but on the way he met
      Father Conway, the priest He was a youngish man and a tremendous patriot,
      supposed to be hand-in-glove with the rebels. Dad explained to him that he
      had less than an hour to live and advised him to go home and bury any
      valuables he possessed before the shelling began. It took Father Conway
      about ten minutes to grasp the situation. I chipped in and explained the
      bracket system on which artillery works. I told him that they wouldn't
      begin by aiming at the court house, but would drop their first shell on
      his house and their next on ours, so as to get the range right. As soon as
      he believed that&mdash;and I had to swear it was true before he did&mdash;he
      took the matter up warmly and said he'd talk to O'Farrelly himself. I
      didn't think he'd do much good, but I went into the court house with him,
      just to see what he'd say. I must say for him he wasted no time. It was a
      quarter past seven when he began, so there wasn't much time to waste."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Boys,' he said, 'will you tell me straight and plain what is it you
      want?' O'Farrelly began a long speech about an Irish republic and things
      of that kind. I sat with my watch in my hand opposite Father Conway and
      every now and then I pointed to the hands, so as to remind him that time
      was going on. At twenty-five past seven he stopped O'Farrelly and said
      they couldn't have an Irish republic just then&mdash;though they might
      later&mdash;on account of that gun. Then he asked them again to say
      exactly what they wanted, republics being considered a wash-out You'd have
      been surprised if you heard the answer he got Every man in the place stood
      up and shouted that he asked nothing better than to die for Ireland. They
      meant it, too. I thought it was all up and Father Conway was done. But he
      wasn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Who's preventing you?' he said. 'Just form fours in the square outside
      and you'll all be dead in less than half an hour. But if you stay here a
      lot of other people who don't want to die for Ireland or anything else
      will be killed too; along with having their homes knocked down on them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, they saw the sense of that. O'Farrelly formed his men up outside
      and made a speech to them. He said if any man funked it he could stay
      where he was and only those who really wanted to die need go on. It was a
      quarter to eight when he finished talking and I was in terror of my life
      that there'd be some delay getting rid of the men who fell out But there
      wasn't a single defaulter. Every blessed one of those men&mdash;and most
      of them were only boys&mdash;did a right turn and marched out of the town
      in column of fours. I can tell you, Waterhouse, I didn't like watching
      them go. Father Conway and my dad were standing on the steps of the court
      house, blubbering like children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose they weren't all killed?" said Waterhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None of them were killed," said Power. "There wasn't a shot fired. You
      see, when the English officer saw them march out of the town he naturally
      thought they'd come to surrender, and didn't fire on them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He couldn't possibly have thought that," said Waterhouse, "unless they
      laid down their arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact," said Power, "hardly any of them had any arms,
      except hockey sticks, and the Colonel thought they'd piled them up
      somewhere. He seems to have been a decent sort of fellow. He made
      O'Farrelly and a few more prisoners, and told the rest of them to be off
      home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ireland," said Waterhouse, "must be a d____d queer country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the only country in Europe," said Power, "which knows how to conduct
      war in a civilized way. Now if a situation of that sort turned up out here
      there'd be bloodshed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose O'Farrelly was hanged afterwards?" said Waterhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he wasn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shot, then? Though I should think hanging is the proper death for a
      rebel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor shot," said Power. "He is alive still and quite well. He's going
      about the country making speeches. He was down in Ballymahon about a
      fortnight ago and called on my dad to thank him for all he'd done during
      the last rebellion. He inquired after me in the kindest way. The old dad
      was greatly touched, especially when a crowd of about a thousand men, all
      O'Farrelly's original army with a few new recruits, gathered round the
      house and cheered, first for an Irish republic and then for dad. He made
      them a little speech and told them I'd got my company and was recommended
      for the M.C. When they heard that they cheered me like anything and then
      shouted 'Up the Rebels!' for about ten minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I needn't tell you," said Waterhouse, "that I don't believe a word of
      that story. If I did I'd say&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd say that Ireland&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Power, "that Ireland&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd say that Ireland is a country of lunatics," said Waterhouse, "and
      there ought to be an Irish Republic I can't think of anything to say worse
      than that."

    <h2>
      XV ~~ THE MERMAID
    </h2>
    <p>
      We were on our way home from Inishmore, where we had spent two days; Peter
      O'Flaherty among his relatives&mdash;for everyone on the island was kin to
      him&mdash;I among friends who give me a warm welcome when I go to them.
      The island lies some seventeen miles from the coast We started on our
      homeward sail with a fresh westerly wind. Shortly after midday it backed
      round to the north and grew lighter. At five o'clock we were stealing
      along very gently through calm water with our mainsail boom out against
      the shroud. The jib and foresail were drooping in limp folds. An hour
      later the mainsheet was hanging in the water and the boat drifted with the
      tide. Peter, crouching in the fore part of the cockpit, hissed through his
      clenched teeth, which is the way in which he whistles for a wind. He
      glanced all round the horizon, searching for signs of a breeze. His eyes
      rested finally on the sun, which lay low among some light, fleecy clouds.
      He gave it as his opinion that when it reached the point of setting it
      "might draw a light air after it from the eastward." For that it appeared
      we were to wait I shrank from toil with the heavy sweeps. So, I am sure
      did Peter, who is a good man in a boat but averse from unnecessary labour.
      And there was really no need to row. The tide was carrying us homeward,
      and our position was pleasant enough. Save for the occasional drag of a
      block against the horse we had achieved unbroken silence and almost
      perfect peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drifted slowly past Carrigeen Glos, a low, sullen line of rocks. A
      group of cormorants, either gorged with mackerel fry or hopeless of an
      evening meal, perched together at one end of the reef, and stared at the
      setting sun. A few terns swept round and round overhead, soaring or
      sliding downwards with easy motion. A large seal lay basking on a bare
      rock just above the water's edge. I pointed it out to Peter, and he said
      it was a pity I had not got my rifle with me. I did not agree with him. If
      I had brought the rifle Peter would have insisted on my shooting at the
      seal. I should certainly not have hit it on purpose, for I am averse from
      injuring gentle creatures; but I might perhaps have killed or wounded it
      by accident, for my shooting is very uncertain. In any case I should have
      broken nature's peace, and made a horrible commotion. Perhaps the seal
      heard Peter's remark or divined his feeling of hostility. It flopped
      across the rock and slid gracefully into the sea. We saw it afterwards
      swimming near the boat, looking at us with its curiously human, tender
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man might mistake it for a mermaid," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'd have to be a fool altogether that would do the like," said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was scornful; but the seal's eyes were human. They made me think of
      mermaids.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Them ones," said Peter, "is entirely different from seals. You might see
      a seal any day in fine weather. They're plenty. But the other ones&mdash;But
      sure you wouldn't care to be hearing about them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've heard plenty about them," I said, "but it was all poetry and
      nonsense. You know well enough, Peter, that there's no such thing as a
      mermaid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter filled his pipe slowly and lit it I could see by the way he puffed
      at it that he was full of pity and contempt for my scepticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come now," I said: "did you ever see a mermaid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not," said Peter, "but my mother was acquainted with one. That was
      in Inishmore, where I was born and reared."
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited. The chance of getting Peter to tell an interesting story is to
      wait patiently. Any attempt to goad him on by asking questions is like
      striking before a fish is hooked. The chance of getting either story or
      fish is spoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a young fellow in the island them times," said Peter, "called
      Anthony O'Flaherty. A kind of uncle of my father's he was, and a very fine
      man. There wasn't his equal at running or lepping, and they say he was
      terrible daring on the sea. That was before my mother was born, but she
      heard tell of what he did. When she knew him he was like an old man, and
      the heart was gone out of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Peter stopped. His pipe had gone out. He relit it with
      immense deliberation. I made a mistake. By way of keeping the conversation
      going I asked a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he see a mermaid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did," said Peter, "and what's more he married one."
    </p>
    <p>
      There Peter stopped again abruptly, but with an air of finality. He had,
      so I gathered, told me all he was going to tell me about the mermaid. I
      had blundered badly in asking my question. I suppose that some note of
      unsympathetic scepticism in my tone suggested to Peter that I was inclined
      to laugh at him. I did my best to retrieve my position. I sat quite silent
      and stared at the peak of the mainsail. The block on the horse rattled
      occasionally. The sun's rim touched the horizon. At last Peter was
      reassured and began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was my mother told me about it, and she knew, for many's the time she
      did be playing with the young lads, her being no more than a little
      girleen at the time. Seven of them there was, and the second eldest was
      the one age with my mother. That was after herself left him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herself" was vague enough; but I did not venture to ask another question.
      I took my eyes off the peak of the mainsail and fixed them inquiringly on
      Peter. It was as near as I dared go to asking a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herself," said Peter, "was one of them ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded sideways over the gunwale of the boat. The sea, though still
      calm, was beginning to be moved by that queer restlessness which comes on
      it at sunset. The tide eddied in mysteriously oily swirls. The rocks to
      the eastward of us had grown dim. A gull flew by overhead uttering wailing
      cries. The graceful terns had disappeared. A cormorant, flying so low that
      its wing-tips broke the water, sped across our bows to some far
      resting-place. I fell into a mood of real sympathy with stories about
      mermaids. I think Peter felt the change which had come over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anthony O'Flaherty," said Peter, "was a young man when he saw them first.
      It was in the little bay back west of the island, and my mother never
      rightly knew what he was doing there in the middle of the night; but there
      he was. It was the bottom of a low spring tide, and there's rocks off the
      end of the bay that's uncovered at the ebb of the springs. You've maybe
      seen them."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen them, and Peter knew it well I have seen more of them than I
      want to. There was an occasion when Peter and I lay at anchor in that bay,
      and a sudden shift of wind set us to beating out at three o'clock in the
      morning. The rocks were not uncovered then, but the waves were breaking
      fiercely over them. We had little room for tacking, and I am not likely to
      forget the time we went about a few yards to windward of them. The stretch
      of wild surf under our lee looked ghastly white in the dim twilight of the
      dawn. Peter knew what I was thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was calm enough that night Anthony O'Flaherty was there," he said,
      "and there was a moon shining, pretty near a full moon, so Anthony could
      see plain. Well, there was three of them in it, and they playing
      themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mermaids?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This time my voice expressed full sympathy. The sea all round us was
      rising in queer round little waves, though there was no wind. The boom
      snatched at the blocks as the boat rocked The sail was ghostly white. The
      vision of a mermaid would not have surprised me greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The beautifulest ever was seen," said Peter, "and neither shift nor shirt
      on them, only just themselves, and the long hair of them. Straight it was
      and black, only for a taste of green in it. You wouldn't be making a
      mistake between the like of them and seals, not if you'd seen them right
      the way Anthony O'Flaherty did."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter made this reflection a little bitterly. I was afraid the
      recollection of my unfortunate remark about seals might have stopped him
      telling the story, but it did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once Anthony had seen them," he said, "he couldn't rest content without
      he'd be going to see them again. Many a night he went and saw neither
      sight nor light of them, for it was only at spring tides that they'd be
      there, on account of the rocks not being uncovered any other time. But at
      the bottom of the low springs they were there right enough, and sometimes
      they'd be swimming in the sea and sometimes they'd be sitting on the
      rocks. It was wonderful the songs they'd sing&mdash;like the sound of the
      sea set to music was what my mother told me, and she was told by them that
      knew. The people did be wondering what had come over Anthony, for he was
      different like from what he had been, and nobody knew what took him out of
      his house in the middle of the night at the spring tides. There was a girl
      that they had laid down for him to marry, and Anthony had no objection to
      her before he seen them ones; but after he had seen them he wouldn't look
      at the girl. She had a middling good fortune too but sure he didn't care
      about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      I could understand Anthony's feelings. The air of wind which Peter had
      promised, drawn from its cave by the lure of the departing sun, was
      filling our head-sails. I hauled in the main-sheet gently hand over hand
      and belayed it The boat slipped quietly along close-hauled. The long line
      of islands which guards the entrance of our bay lay dim before use. Over
      the shoulder of one of them I could see the lighthouse, still a
      distinguishable patch of white against the looming grey of the land. The
      water rippled mournfully under our bows and a long pale wake stretched
      astern from our counter. "Fortune," banked money, good heifers and even
      enduringly fruitful fields seemed very little matters to me then. They
      must have seemed still less, far less, to Anthony O'Flaherty after he had
      seen those white sea-maidens with their green-black hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a woman on the island in those times," said Peter, "a very aged
      woman, and she had a kind of plaster which she made which cured the
      cancer, drawing it out by the roots, and she could tell what was good for
      the chin cough, and the women did like to have her with them when their
      children was born, she being knowledgable in them matters. I'm told the
      priests didn't like her, for there was things she knew which it mightn't
      be right that anyone would know, things that's better left to the clergy.
      Whether she guessed what was the matter with Anthony, or whether he up and
      told her straight my mother never heard. It could be that he told her, for
      many a one used to go to her for a charm when the butter wouldn't come, or
      a cow, maybe, was pining; so it wouldn't surprise me if Anthony went to
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter crept aft He took a pull on the jib-sheet and belayed it again; but
      I do not believe that he really cared much about the set of the sail. That
      was his excuse. He wanted to be nearer to me. There is something in
      stories like this, told in dim twilight, with dark waters sighing near at
      hand, which makes men feel the need of close human companionship. Peter
      seated himself on the floorboards at my feet, and I felt a certain comfort
      in the touch of his arm on my leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he went on, "according to the old hag&mdash;and what she said was
      true enough, however she learnt it&mdash;them ones doesn't go naked all
      the time, but only when they're playing themselves on the rocks at low
      tide, the way Anthony seen them. Mostly they have a kind of cloak that
      they wear, and they take the same cloaks off of them when they're up above
      the water and they lay them down on the rocks. If so be that a man could
      pat his hand on e'er a cloak, the one that owned it would have to follow
      him whether she wanted to or not. If it was to the end of the world she'd
      have to follow him, or to Spain, or to America, or wherever he might go.
      And what's more, she'd have to do what he bid her, be the same good or
      bad, and be with him if he wanted her, so long as he kept the cloak from
      her. That's what the old woman told Anthony, and she was a skilful woman,
      well knowing the nature of beasts and men, and of them that's neither
      beasts nor men. You'll believe me now that Anthony wasn't altogether the
      same as other men when I tell you that he laid his mind down to get his
      hand down on one of the cloaks. He was a good swimmer, so he was, which is
      what few men on the island can do, and he knew that he'd be able to fetch
      out to the rock where them ones played themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was quite prepared to believe that Anthony was inspired by a passion far
      out of the common. I know nothing more terrifying than the chill embrace
      of the sea at night-time. To strike out through the slimy weeds which lie
      close along the surface at the ebb point of a spring tide, to clamber on
      low rocks, half awash for an hoar or two at midnight, these are things
      which I would not willingly do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first time he went for to try it," said Peter, "he felt a bit queer
      in himself and he thought it would do him no harm if he was to bless
      himself. So he did, just as he was stepping off the shore into the water.
      Well, it might as well have been a shot he fired, for the minute he did it
      they were off and their cloaks along with them; and Anthony was left
      there. It was the sign of the cross had them frightened, for that same is
      what they can't stand, not having souls that religion would be any use to.
      It was the old woman told Anthony that after, and you'd think it would
      have been a warning to him not to make or meddle with the like of them any
      more. But it only made him the more determined. He went about without
      speaking to man or woman, and if anybody spoke to him he'd curse terrible,
      till the time of the next spring tide. Then he was off to the bay again,
      and sure enough them ones was there. The water was middling rough that
      night, but it didn't daunt Anthony. It pleased him, for he thought he'd
      have a better chance of getting to the rocks without them taking notice of
      him if there was some noise loud enough to drown the noise he'd be making
      himself. So he crept out to the point of the cliff on the south side of
      the bay, which is as near as he could get to the rocks. You remember
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I did. On the night when we beat out of the bay against a rising westerly
      wind we went about once under the shadow of the cliff, and, almost before
      we had full way on the boat, stayed her again beside the rocks. Anthony's
      swim, though terrifying, was short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That time he neither blessed himself nor said a prayer, but slipped into
      the water, and off with him, swimming with all his strength. They didn't
      see him, for they were too busy with their playing to take much notice,
      and of course they couldn't be expecting a man to be there. Without
      Anthony had shouted they wouldn't have heard him, for the sea was loud on
      the rocks and their own singing was louder. So Anthony got there and he
      crept up on the rock behind them, and the first thing his hand touched was
      one of the cloaks. He didn't know which of them it belonged to, and he
      didn't care. It wasn't any one of the three in particular he wanted, for
      they were all much about the same to look at, only finer than any woman
      ever was seen. So he rolled the cloak round his neck, the way he'd have
      his arms free for swimming, and back with him into the water, heading for
      shore as fast as he was able."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she followed him?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She did so. From that day till the day she left him she followed him, and
      she did what she was bid, only for one thing. She wouldn't go to mass, and
      when the chapel bell rang she'd hide herself. The sound of it was what she
      couldn't bear. The people thought that queer, and there was a deal of talk
      about it in the bland, some saying she must be a Protestant, and more
      thinking that she might be something worse. But nobody had a word to say
      against her any other way. She was a good enough housekeeper, washing and
      making and mending for Anthony, and minding the children. Seven of them
      there was, and all boys."
    </p>
    <p>
      The easterly breeze freshened as the night fell I could see the great eye
      of the lighthouse blinking at me on the weather side of the boat. It
      became necessary to go about, but I gave the order to Peter very
      reluctantly. He handled the head-sheets, and then, instead of settling
      down in his old place, leaned his elbows on the coaming and stared into
      the sea. We were steadily approaching the lighthouse. I felt that I must
      run the risk of asking him a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What happened in the end?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The end, is it? Well, in the latter end she left him. But there was
      things happened before that. Whether it was the way the priests talked to
      him about her&mdash;there was a priest in it them times that was too fond
      of interfering, and that's what some of them are&mdash;or whether there
      was goings-on within in the inside of the house that nobody knew anything
      about&mdash;and there might have been, for you couldn't tell what one of
      them ones might do or mightn't Whatever way it was, Anthony took to
      drinking more than he ought. There was poteen made on the island then, and
      whisky was easy come by if a man wanted it, and Anthony took too much of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter paused and then passed judgment, charitably, on Anthony's conduct "I
      wouldn't be too hard on a man for taking a drop an odd time."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad to hear Peter say that I myself had found it necessary from
      time to time, for the sake of an old friendship, not to be too hard on
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody would have blamed him," Peter went on, "if he had behaved himself
      when he had a drop taken; but that's what he didn't seem able to do. He
      bet her. Sore and heavy he bet her, and that's what no woman, whether she
      was a natural woman or one of the other kind, could be expected to put up
      with. Not that she said a word. She didn't. Nor nobody would have known
      that he bet her if he hadn't token to beating the young lads along with
      her. It was them told what was going on. But there wasn't one on the
      island would interfere. The people did be wondering that she didn't put
      the fear of God into Anthony; but of course that's what she couldn't do on
      account of his having the cloak hid away from her. So long as he had that
      she was bound to put up with whatever he did. But it wasn't for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The house was going to rack and ruin with the way Anthony wouldn't mind
      it on account of his being three-parts drunk most of the time. At last the
      rain was coming in through the roof. When Anthony saw that he came to
      himself a bit and sent for my grandfather and settled with him to put a
      few patches of new thatch on the worst places. My grandfather was the best
      man at thatching that there was in the island in them days, and he took
      the job though he misdoubted whether he'd ever be paid for it. Anthony
      never came next or nigh him when he was working, which shows that he
      hadn't got his senses rightly. If he had he'd have kept an eye on what my
      grandfather was doing, knowing what he knew, though of course my
      grandfather didn't know. Well, one day my grandfather was dragging off the
      old thatch near the chimney. It was middling late in the evening, as it
      might be six or seven o'clock, and he was thinking of stopping his work
      when all of a sudden he came on what he thought might be an old petticoat
      bundled away in the thatch. It was red, he said, but when he put his hand
      on it he knew it wasn't flannel, nor it wasn't cloth, nor it wasn't like
      anything he'd ever felt before in all his life. There was a hole in the
      roof where my grandfather had the thatch stripped, and he could see down
      into the kitchen. Anthony's wife was there with the youngest of the boys
      in her arms. My grandfather was as much in dread of her as every other
      one, but he thought it would be no more than civil to tell her what he'd
      found.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Begging your pardon, ma'am,' he said, 'but I'm after finding what maybe
      belongs to you hid away in the thatch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "With that he threw down the red cloak, for it was a red cloak he had in
      his hand. She didn't speak a word, but she laid down the baby out of her
      arms and she walked out of the house. That was the last my father seen of
      her. And that was the last anyone on the island seen of her, unless maybe
      Anthony. Nobody knows what he saw. He stopped off the drink from that day;
      but it wasn't much use his stopping it. He used to go round at spring
      tides to the bay where he had seen her first He did that five times, or
      maybe six. After that he took to his bed and died. It could be that his
      heart was broke."
    </p>
    <p>
      We slipped past the point of the pier. Peter crept forward and crouched on
      the deck in front of the mast I peered into the gloom to catch sight of
      our mooring-buoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let her away a bit yet," said Peter. "Now luff her, luff her all you
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat edged up into the wind. Peter, flat on his stomach, grasped the
      buoy and hauled it on board. The fore-sheets beat their tattoo on the
      deck. The boom swung sharply across the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later we were leaning together across the boom gathering in
      the mainsail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What became of the boys?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it Anthony O'Flaherty's boys? The last of them went to America twenty
      years ago. But sure that was before you came to these parts."

      XVI ~~ AN UPRIGHT JUDGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      No one knows how the quarrel between Peter Joyce and Patrick Joseph
      Flanagan began. It had been smouldering for years, a steady-going feud,
      before it reached its crisis last June.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Joyces and Flanagans were neighbours, occupying farms of very poor
      land on the side of Letterbrack, a damp and lonely hill some miles from
      the nearest market town. This fact explains the persistence of the feud.
      It is not easy to keep up a quarrel with a man whom you only see once a
      month or so. Nor is it possible to concentrate the mind on one particular
      enemy if you live in a crowded place. Joyce and Flanagan saw each other
      every day. They could not help seeing each other, for their farms were
      small. They scarcely ever saw anyone else, because there were no other
      farms on the side of the hill. And the feud was a family affair. Mrs.
      Joyce and Mrs. Flanagan disliked each other heartily and never met without
      using language calculated to embitter the feeling between them. The young
      Joyces and the young Flanagans fought fiercely on their way to and from
      school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war, which has turned Europe upside down and dragged most things from
      their familiar moorings, had its effect on the lives of the two farmers on
      the side of Letterbrack. They became better off than they had ever been
      before. It must not be supposed that they grew rich. According to the
      standard of English working men they had always been wretchedly poor. All
      that the war did for them was to put a little, a very little, more money
      into their pockets. They themselves did not connect their new prosperity
      with the war. They did not, indeed, think about the war at all, bring
      fully occupied with their work and their private quarrel. They noticed,
      without inquiring into causes, that the prices of the things they sold
      went up steadily. A lean bullock fetched an amazing sum at a fair. Young
      pigs proved unexpectedly profitable. The eggs which the women carried into
      town on market days could be exchanged for unusual quantities of tea. And
      the rise in prices was almost pure gain to these farmers. They lived for
      the most part on the produce of their own land and bought very little in
      shops. There came a time when Peter Joyce had a comfortable sum, about 20
      in all, laid by after making provision for his rent and taxes. He felt
      entitled to some little indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Englishman, when he finds himself in possession of spare cash spends it
      on material luxuries for himself and, if he is a good man, for his family.
      He buys better food, better clothes, and furniture of a kind not
      absolutely necessary, like pianos. An Irishman, in a similar agreeable
      position, prefers pleasures of a more spiritual kind. Peter Joyce was
      perfectly content to wear a "bawneen" of homemade flannel and a pair of
      ragged trousers. He did not want anything better for dinner than boiled
      potatoes and fried slices of bacon. He had not the smallest desire to
      possess a piano or even an armchair. But he intended, in his own way, to
      get solid enjoyment out of his 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after the children had gone to bed one evening that he discussed
      the matter with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not sure," he said, "but it might be as well to settle things up one
      way or another with that old reprobate Patrick Joseph Flanagan. It's what
      I'll have to do sooner or later."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Them Flanagans," said Mrs. Joyce, "is the devil. There isn't a day passes
      but one or other of them has me tormented. If it isn't her it's one of the
      children, and if, by the grace of God, it isn't the children it's
      herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I'm thinking of," said Joyce, "is taking the law of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It'll cost you something to do that," said Mrs. Joyce cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if it does, what matter? Haven't I the money to pay for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have," said Mrs. Joyce. "You have surely. And Flanagan deserves it,
      so he does. It's not once nor twice, but it's every day I do be saying
      there's something should be done to them Flanagans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's more will be done to him than he cares for," said Joyce grimly.
      "Wait till the County Court Judge gets at him. Believe me he'll be sorry
      for himself then."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Joyce started early next morning. He had an eight-mile walk before
      him and he wished to reach the town in good time, being anxious to put his
      case into the hands of Mr. Madden, the solicitor, before Mr. Madden became
      absorbed in the business of the day. Mr. Madden had the reputation of
      being the smartest lawyer in Connaught, and his time was very fully
      occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took Joyce nearly three hours to reach the town and he had ample time
      to prepare his case against Flanagan as he went There was no lack of
      material for the lawsuit A feud of years' standing provides many
      grievances which can fairly be brought into court. Joyce's difficulty was
      to make a choice. He pondered deeply as he walked along the bare road
      across the bog. When he reached the door of Mr. Madden's office he had a
      tale of injuries suffered at the hands of the Flanagans which would, he
      felt sure, move the judge to vindictive fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Madden was already busy when Joyce was shown unto his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "who are you and what do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name's Peter Joyce of Letterbrack, your honour," said Joyce. "A decent
      man with a long weak family, and my father was a decent man before me, and
      it's no fault of mine that I'm here to-day, and going into court, though
      there isn't another gentleman in all Ireland I'd sooner come to than
      yourself, Mr. Madden, if so be I had to come to anyone. And it's what I'm
      druv to, for if I wasn't&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" said Mr. Madden. "Police? Drunk and disorderly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not," said Joyce. "Sure I never was took by the police only twice,
      and them times they wouldn't have meddled with me only for the spite the
      sergeant had against me. But he's gone from the place now, thanks be to
      God, and the one that came after him wouldn't touch me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Joyce sank his voice to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's how I want to take the law of Patrick Joseph Flanagan," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trespass or assault?" said Mr. Madden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of immense experience. He succeeded in carrying on a large
      practice because he wasted no time in listening to preliminary
      explanations of his clients. Most legal actions in the West of Ireland are
      reducible to trespass or assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's both the two of them," said Joyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Madden made a note on a sheet of paper before him. Joyce waited until
      he had finished writing. Then he said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trespass and assault and more besides."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Madden asked no question. He added to the note he had written the
      words "And abusive language." Abusive language generally follows trespass
      and immediately precedes assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said Mr. Madden, "get on with your story and make it as short as
      you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Joyce did his best to make the story short He succeeded in making it
      immensely complicated. There was a boundary wall in the story and it had
      been broken down. There was a heifer calf and a number of young pigs.
      There was a field of oats trampled and destroyed by the heifer, and a
      potato patch ruined beyond hope by the pigs. There was a sheep torn by a
      dog, stones thrown at Mrs. Joyce, language that had defiled the ears of
      Molly Joyce, an innocent child of twelve years old, and there was the
      shooting of a gun at Peter himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce was prepared to swear to every item of the indictment. He did
      actually swear from time to time, laying his hand solemnly on a large
      ledger which stood on Mr. Madden's desk. Mr. Madden listened until he had
      heard enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't a ghost of a case against Flanagan," he said. "The judge
      won't listen to a story like that. If you take my advice you'll go
      straight home and make it up with Flanagan. You'll simply waste your money
      if you go into court."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Madden, it will be seen, was a man of principle. He made his living
      out of other people's quarrels, but he gave honest advice to his clients.
      He was also a man of wide knowledge of West of Ireland fanners. He knew
      perfectly well that his advice would not be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've the money to pay for it," said Joyce, "and I'll have the law of
      Patrick Joseph Flanagan if it costs me the last penny I own. If your
      honour doesn't like the case sure I can go to someone else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Madden, though a man of principle, was not quixotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," he said. "I'll manage your case for you; but I warn you
      fairly the judge will give it against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might not," said Joyce. "In the latter end he might not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will," said Mr. Madden, "unless&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was watching Joyce carefully as he spoke. The man's face had an
      expression of cunning and self-satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless," Mr. Madden went on, "you've something up your sleeve that you
      haven't told me yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce winked solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's what it would be hardly worth mentioning to your honour," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better mention it all the same," said Mr. Madden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I was thinking," said Joyce, "is that if I was to send a pair of
      ducks to the judge a couple of days before the case was to come on&mdash;fine
      ducks we have, as fine as ever was seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me," said Mr. Madden. "You've got the very smallest possible
      chance of winning your case. But you have a chance. It's a hundred to one
      against you. Still, odd things do happen in courts. But let me tell you
      this. I know that judge. I've known him for years, and if you try to bribe
      him with a pair of ducks he'd give it against you even if you had the best
      case in the world instead of the worst. That's the kind of man he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce sighed heavily. The ways of the law were proving unexpectedly
      difficult and expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe," he said, "I could send him two pair of ducks, or two pair and a
      half, but that's the most I can do; and there won't be a young duck left
      about the place if I send him that many."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Either you act by my advice," said Mr. Madden, "or I'll drop your case.
      This isn't a matter for the local bench of magistrates. If it was them you
      were dealing with, ducks might be some use to you. But a County Court
      Judge is a different kind of man altogether. He's a gentleman, and he's
      honest. If you attempt to get at him with ducks or any other kind of bribe
      you'll ruin any chance you have, which isn't much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a queer thing now, so it is," said Joyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true all the same," said Mr. Madden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to tell me," said Joyce, "that his honour, the judge, would
      go against a man that had done him a good turn in the way of a pair of
      ducks or the like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's exactly what I do mean," said Mr. Madden. "No judge would stand it
      And the one who presides over this court would be even angrier than most
      of them, so don't you do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce left Mr. Madden's office a few minutes later, and tramped home. In
      spite of the lawyer's discouraging view of the case he seemed fairly well
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening he spoke to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many of them large white dukes have you?" he asked; "how many that's
      fit to eat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no more than six left out of the first clutch," said Mrs. Joyce.
      "There was eleven hatched out, but sure the rats got the rest of them."
      "I'd be glad," said Joyce, "if you'd fatten them six, and you needn't
      spare the yellow meal. It'll be worth your while to have them as good as
      you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      A month later the case of Joyce v. Flanagan came on in the County Court.
      Mr. Madden had hammered the original story of the wall, the heifer, the
      pigs and the potatoes, into shape. It sounded almost plausible as Mr.
      Madden told it in his opening remarks. But he had very little hopes that
      it would survive the handling of Mr. Ellis, a young and intelligent
      lawyer, who was acting for Flanagan. Joyce cheerfully confirmed every
      detail of the story on oath. He was unshaken by Mr. Ellis'
      cross-examination, chiefly because the judge constantly interfered with
      Mr. Ellis and would not allow him to ask the questions he wanted to ask.
      Flanagan and his witnesses did their best, but the judge continued to make
      things as difficult as he could for their lawyer. The matter, when all the
      evidence was heard, appeared tangled and confused, a result far beyond Mr.
      Madden's best expectations. He had feared that the truth might emerge with
      disconcerting plainness. Then an amazing thing happened The judge took
      Joyce's view of the circumstances and decided in his favour. Mr. Ellis
      gasped. Flanagan swore audibly and was silenced by a policeman. Joyce left
      the court with a satisfied smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mr. Madden, a little later, "you've won, but I'm damned if I
      know how it happened. I never went into court with a shakier case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't wonder," said Joyce, "but it might have been the ducks that
      did it. I sent him six, your honour, six, and as fat as any duck ever you
      seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord!" said Mr. Madden. "After all I said to you&mdash;and&mdash;but,
      good heavens, man! He can't have got them. If he had&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He got them right enough," said Joyce, "for I left them at the door of
      the hotel myself, with a bit of a note, saying as how I hoped he'd take a
      favourable view of the case that would be before him to-day, and I told
      him what the case was, so as there'd be no mistake&mdash;Joyce v. Flanagan
      was what I wrote, in a matter of trespass and assault, and abusive
      language."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mr. Madden, "all I can say is that if I hadn't seen with my
      own eyes what happened in that court to-day I wouldn't have believed it To
      think that the judge, of all men&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was Flanagan's name and not my own," said Joyce, "that I signed at the
      bottom of the note. 'With the respectful compliments of Patrick Joseph
      Flanagan, the defendant,' was what I wrote, like as if it was from him
      that the ducks came."

      You'll be a Cabinet Minister before you die."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
